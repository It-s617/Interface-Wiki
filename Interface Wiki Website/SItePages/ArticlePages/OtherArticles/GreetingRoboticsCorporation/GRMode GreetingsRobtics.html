            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the events of Henryk’s family in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>

            Before 1925: Mr Greetings are born.

        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Mr Greetings must have been born at least 18 years before joining the military so the earliest 
            possible date for him being born is 1925, it is possible they were born before this.

        <p>
            The events of The Philadelphia Experiment is repeatedly mentioned to have taken places in 1943.

        <p>
            After 1945, 1: Greetings Robotics is founded by Mr Greetings.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1945, 2: The Mechanical Saccorhytus is bult by Greetings Robotics presumably ordered by Mr Greetings.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We do not get much information on when Greetings Robotics was founded but it can be assumed that this was shortly after 
            World War 2 as Mr Greeting is a very well-known and established person in The Interfaces world which would imply that he 
            has been actively working for quite some time.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            It is easy to assume that The Mechanical Saccorhytus was more likely bult during the 2000s but we do not get any information
            on when it was bult or unveiled so all I can say for sure is that it was bult after World War 2. Additionally, it is possible
            that the blimp was originally made earlier, and latter modified into The Mechanical Saccorhytus.

            Before 2017: The Wind is scanned by Greetings Robotics, or they somehow partially capture him.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            We see in the scenes of KAMI’s programming from episode 18, that she has data from The Wind but has not captured him. 
            This is never greatly elaborated upon so this would be my best gusset.

            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

                <b>
                   What Dose Greetings Robotics Mean by Restoration   
                </b>
                <p>
                   The stated goal of the Greetings Robotics Corporation is restoration however what this mean is not really explained in the 
                   show. I believe that there are three different gaols enclosed in this, I will elaborate bellow.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                

                <i>
                   Meaning One: remove cerebral electricity from the world.
                </i>
                <p>
                   Mr Greetings clearly wants to just completely remove cerebral electricity from the world but knows that he can’t as this seems 
                   to be a fundamental part of the universe. I believe that as he knows this his goal has now changed to trying to completely 
                   control all the cerebral electricity in the world.
                </p>
                <br><br> 

                <i>
                   Meaning Two: Removal Of Cerebral Electricity Monsters from The World
                </i>
                <p>
                   Well Mr Greetings cannot fully remove cerebral electricity from the world, but he likely could succeed in capturing and 
                   repurposing all the cerebral electricity monsters in the world, this would help to return the world to a state like it was 
                   in 1943. 
                </p>
                <br><br> 
                <i>
                   Meaning Three: Creation Of the Interface 
                </i>
                <p>
                   One of other clear gaols of greetings robotics is to build The Interfaces a form of digital afterlife, fuelled by cerebral 
                   electricity. This is seemingly intended to be a simulation of the world without cerebral electricity. A world without cerebral 
                   electricity would represent the ultimate return to normalcy from Mr Greetings prospective.
                </p>
                <br><br> 

                <b>Analysis of Mr Greetings</b>
                <br><br> 
                
                
                
                <b>Mr Greetings Represents the Past </b>
                <p>
                    I believe that both Henryk and Mr Greetings represent the past, I believe that Mr Greetings is meant to represent the old 
                    people in the world that refuse to except that the world has moved on from when they were young and are scared of the new world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is pretty clear throughout the series especially in Episode 21 Restoration where Mr Greetings admits that a lot of people born 
                    after 1943 don’t think there’s anything wrong with the new world and don’t understand what the past was like. 
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <b>What Species is Mr Greetings </b>
                <p>
                    Mr Greetings appear to be a regular human being but we see in episode 21 restoration that during the Philadelphia Experiment 
                    that he was transformed into pure cerebral electricity and transformed back into his original form. This would seemingly 
                    imply that he is no longer purely human but it is not completely clear.
                </p>

                <b>Analysis of KAMI</b>
                <br><br> 
                
                <b>KAMI Represents The Loss Of Individuality To Society </b>
                <p>                
                    Individuality is something that seems particularly important to the series, Mischief is arguably meant to represent 
                    individualisation, noticeably in episode 22 quoting The Red Book which is all about individuality.
                </p>
                <p>               
                    KAMI how is directly antithetical to Mischief seems to be some form of robot that is powered by the collected Cerebral 
                    Electricity of the dead. I think this may be meant to represent the loss of individuality that society often tries to 
                    enforce, practically by people who are like Mr Greetings and are obsessed with an idea of how the world is meant to be.
                </p>
                <br><br> 

                <b>Analysis of The Mechanical Saccorhytus</b>
                <br><br> 

                <b>Why Have KAMI When The Mechanical Saccorhytus Is So Much Stronger </b>
                <p>
                    During her fight with The Chef, we see that The Chef was capable of beating KAMI before The Mechanical Saccorhytus using 
                    The Ghosts powers appears behind him capturing him. We also see that after KAMI self-destruction The Mechanical Saccorhytus 
                    is sent in to capture Mischief, this leads to the question why Greetings Robotics needed KAMI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this is simply because KAMI is easier to control and can be relied upon while The Mechanical Saccorhytus is unreliable.
                    When The Mechanical Saccorhytus is in his baby form he is massively emotionally and seams easily distracted likely meaning 
                    that he is not reliable for capturing other Cerebral electricity monsters.
