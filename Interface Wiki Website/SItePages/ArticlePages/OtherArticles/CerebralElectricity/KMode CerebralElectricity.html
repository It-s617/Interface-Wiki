            <h2>Description of Cerebral Electricity </h2>   

            <p>
                Cerebral electricity is seemingly a type of energy created by the brain and nerve system of animals and humans, form what we see 
                in the series it seems this is stored in the body until the death of the subject when it is relied through the eyes and mouth.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Cerebral electricity has aways existed in the interfaces universe, but it was not visible to humans until the Philadelphia 
                experiment in 1943, it is not explained how the cerebral electricity was reviled beyond that it has something to do with 
                The USS Eldridge being teleported from Philadelphia to new York. It is implied by Mr Greetings that after the cerebral 
                electricity was realised and understood by humans it could not be rehidden.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Cerebral electricity created a variety of changes in the world not all of which are explained, most noticeable the sky 
                changed colours now usually appearing a shade of red to orange, occasionally being green. metal was shown to also change
                colours usually to pink.
            </p>

            <h2> Analysis </h2> 

            <b>
                Cerebral Electricity Before 1943 
            </b>
            <p>
                Cerebral electricity is confirmed to have existed before 1943 at several points in the series most notably most ghost stories are 
                explained to have been the result of cerebral electricity, this implies that it was possible to become a Cerebral electricity
                monster before 1943.

            </p>
            <p>
                Myths and religions are likely also explained by cerebral electricity having existed prior to 1943. In episode 16 he see Henryk 
                falling from the sky before 1943 noticeably this is implied to be immediately after to his transformation this would imply that 
                humanoid and some of the non humanoid cerebral electricity monster where around prior to 1943 but some were likely not visible.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>
                What Are Cerebral Electricity Monsters 
            </b>
            <p>
                Cerebral electricity monsters are animals usually humans that have ever died leading to there cerebral electricity transforming 
                into a creature based on their memories and perspective or a person who have had there body’s changed into cerebral electricity 
                like what happened in the Philadelphia experiment.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important things to know about cerebral electricity monsters is that there form and powers are seemingly entirely 
                based on their memory’s and perspective of the world.

            </p>
            <p>
                For example let’s look at  Mischief and Mr Greetings, Mischief’s form is clearly based on his costume that he wore as a performer 
                at The Foolish House in Dreamland this could also help to explain his powers which is primarily shown to be transformation, 
                something that would let hi m tell better jokes and help him to fulfil his curiosity which is on of Mischief other prominent 
                character trats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr Greetings on the offer hand appears entirely human and is nether shown to have powers despite the fact we know he has 
                transformed decades ago during the Philadelphia. This is very easily explained by the fact we see that the pre-Philadelphia 
                experiment world and humanity are extremality important to him, likely meaning that his perspective of the world prevented 
                him from significantly changing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would consider there to be two distinct forms of cerebral electricity monsters and one form of creature that is against to 
                cerebral electricity monsters I will explain each bellow.
            </p>

               Complete Cerebral Containment Monsters (CEM Type 1)
            </b>
            <p>
               CEM Type 1’s are the most commonly seen type of cerebral electricity monster. Characters who are in this category are noticeable 
               no humanoid having a verity of physical features that are not considered normal, they also usually have stronger powers.
            </p>
            <p>
               Notable characters in this category are Mischief, The Ghost, The Chef, and The Wind 
            </p>
            <p>
               The transformation process for these characters seams to heavily involve death, we see in episode 21 Mischief rise into the sky 
               still noticeable humanoid and then get shot down into the sea turning into his wormlike form. We also see The Ghost passing of 
               old age, before her realised cerebral electricity is transformed into The Ghost.

            </p>
            <p>
               I believe the transformation into a Complete Cerebral Containment Monster you need to have your physical form destroyed and have 
               a strong enough cerebral electricity to be able to reconstruct a physical form.

            </p>
            <p>
               Unfortunately, the only complete cerebral electricity monsters we see die are absorbed by KAMI of screen so we do not know what 
               happens after they die, it is possible that when they die if they are strong enough they are capable of rebuilding themselves.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>
               Humanoid Cerebral Electricity Monsters (CEM type 2)
            </b>
            <p>
               CEM Type 2’s are people who have been transformed into a CEM but has maintained their human form, they may have some powers, 
               but these will usually be weaker not usually being noticeable.

            </p>
            <p>
               Notable characters in this category are Henryk, and Mr Greeting.
            </p>
            <p>
               The creation of a Humanoid Cerebral Electricity Monsters is a lot less clear, but I think that the main way they come into 
               existence is by having there body’s be converted into cerebral electricity and being able to rematerialize without your body 
               being destroyed like we see happen in the Philadelphia experiment. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This explains Mr Greetings and the navy men that got fused to the hull of the USS Eldridge, but Henryk doesn’t neatly fit into 
               this as he is believed to have died in a nuclear attack that would have destroyed his body. Ther most likely answer to this is 
               that if your body is destroyed or if you die then you can rematerialize as a humanoid but only if you have an extremely strong 
               connection to their humanity. This would also explain why Henryk doesn’t age well Mr Greetings dose, Mr Greetings is still in 
               his human body while Henryk is in a reconstructed body.
            </p>
            <p>
               Noticeable these creatures are still shown to release cerebral electricity when that die the crew of the USS Eldridge were shown 
               to partially dissolve into cerebral electricity after their deaths and Mr Greetings cerebral electricity is seen to leave his body 
               and be absorbed by The Interface after his death. This may imply that they are still capable of a full transformation.
            </p>

               What Are Cerebral Electricity Containers (CEC)
            </b>
            <p>
               CEC’s are not cerebral electricity monsters but are machines most commonly robots that are being used to control 
               and contain cerebral electricity. These characters are shown to have limited sentences as a result of being made 
               from cerebral electricity and have been shown to be massively powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
               Noticeable characters from this category are KAMI, The Mechanical Saccorhytus, and arguable The Interface.
            </p>
            <p>
               These characters are shown to have the memories and abilities of those they have absorbed and in the interface’s 
               case the consciousness of those absorbed by the system are shown to still be functional.
            </p>
            <p>
               If The Oni is the result of KAMI having undergone a transformation after her destruction this would imply that these machines 
               are technically alive.

               Comparistion To Composition 8
            </b>
            <p>
               This painting is used in many episodes when Cerebral electricity is beaning used to create a verity of materials. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I think that this painting was used to help depicted the cerebral electricity transforming from a state of pure energy to 
               having a physical form having shapes and angles.
