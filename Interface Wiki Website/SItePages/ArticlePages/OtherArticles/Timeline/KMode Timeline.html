                Before 1893 Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl is born.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                We know that Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl was working for dreamland in 1911 and appeared to be 
                an adult so that means he was likely born at least 18 years before 1911.            
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                Between 1904-1911: Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl joined the Foolish house in dreamland.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                We know that Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl was working for Dreamland when it burned down meaning 
                he must have been working there before hand, as he is the head on the building it is likely he has there from the 
                beginning, meaning 1904.           
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                1910: Henryk is born.      
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                This is seen on Henrykâ€™s medical record and directly confirmed by Mischief in Episode 8.          
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                1911, 1: Proto-Mischief and The Foolish Girl take a bow on the stage of The Foolish House.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1911, 2: The Ringmaster stands of stage of Proto-Mischief retires and looks upset.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                1911, 3: Proto-Mischief leaves the entertainment industry.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                1911, 4: the same day Proto-Mischief retires dreamland burns down.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1911, 5: The Ringmaster and The Foolish Girl likely leaves the entertainment industry after Dreamland burns down.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                At one point in Episode 21 Mischief says "The year was 1911. Two comedians take a bow, 54 years too soon." This 
                references the painting the two comedians.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                This all implies that Proto-Mischief retired from dreamland and did not leave because of the fire. However, we 
                also see Proto-Mischief watching the fire well dressed in his comedian outfit, implying that he retires the day of the fire.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                The Ringmaster appears noticeably upset during the scene he is shown in Episode 21 this may imply that he and Proto-Mischief 
                had been having problems and one of them may have purposely or accidently set fire to dreamland. This is contradicted by 
                reality where the fire was an accident.             
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                Before 1925: Proto-Chef, Proto-Wind, and Mr Greetings are born.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Proto-Chef, Proto-Wind, and Mr Greetings must have been born at least 18 years before joining the military so the earliest 
                possible date for him being born is 1925, it is possible they were born before this.           
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                Before 1943, 1: Henryk dies accidentally in an nuclear bomb test he was hired to photograph.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Before 1943, 2: Henryk drifts down from the sky in his parachute and meets his wife for the first time, she is working 
                as a nurse at the hospital he is in.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Henryk is implied to have transformed and regained his physicality during the scene we see in Episode 16 of Henryk falling 
                from the sky in his parachute. As the sky is still blue both events must accrue before The Philadelphia Experiment 
                as this noticeable changed the colour of most thing including the sky.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Noticeablely, the first known nuclear bomb test happens on July 16th, 1945, two years after the latest date this could have 
                taken place. This may imply there is a differences nuclear bomb development in the Interfaces universe which could also 
                be implied by the blast evidently being significantly larger than expected resulting in Henrykâ€™s death.

            <p>
                1943, 1: The Philadelphia Experiment accusers teleporting the USS Eldridge to New York from Philadelphia.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 2: Mr Greetings is turned into pure cerebral electricity before rematerializing slightly above the USS Eldridge. 
                Seemingly unharmed and uncharged.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 3:  Proto-Chef and Proto-Wind likely transform into pure cerebral electricity before transform into The Wind 
                and The Chef respectively.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 4: Mr Greetings watches many of the solders aboard the USS Eldridge die after being fussed to the hull of the ship.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 5: Proto-Mischief is turned into pure cerebral electricity before floating into the sky and being shot to death by 
                the military.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 6: Proto-Mischief falls to the earth and fully transforms into a cerebral electricity monster. As Proto-Mischief 
                transforms into Mischief the screen shows pictures of KAMI to compare the two.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                1943, 7: Mischief says boo to Mr Greeting before leaving.

            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                The events of The Philadelphia Experiment is repeatedly mentioned to have taken places in 1943.            
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                After 1945, 1: Henryk plants a tree with his pregnant partner             
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 2: Henrykâ€™s daughter is born, and Henryk becomes a father             
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 3: Henryk marries his wife.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                During Episode 16 we see the tree being planted that is shown in the photo of their wedding. As his wife is not visibly pregnant 
                during the wedding and after the tree has grown, this implies that Henrykâ€™s daughter was born before they were married.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 1: Greetings Robotics is founded by Mr Greetings.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 2: The Mechanical Saccorhytus is bult by Greetings Robotics presumably ordered by Mr Greetings.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                We do not get much information on when Greetings Robotics was founded but it can be assumed that this was shortly after 
                World War 2 as Mr Greeting is a very well-known and established person in The Interfaces world which would imply that he 
                has been actively working for quite some time.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                It is easy to assume that The Mechanical Saccorhytus was more likely bult during the 2000s but we do not get any information
                on when it was bult or unveiled so all I can say for sure is that it was bult after World War 2. Additionally, it is possible
                that the blimp was originally made earlier, and latter modified into The Mechanical Saccorhytus.

            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1953, 2: Henryk attendees his wifeâ€™s funeral with his 
                daughter and the paster who is hosting the funeral, is noticeably freak out by his apparent agelessness.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Henryks daughter mentions in episode 6 that her mom died when she was young but clearly remember details of 
                her funeral and other stories her mom shared with her implying, she was at lest 8 years old as this is the age 
                children usually develop their long-term memory.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Given that Henryk appeared young enough to be noticeable weird it is implied that this likely happened closer 
                to 1963 or 1973 as Henryk would only be 43 in 1953 so looking young would not be weird, however for the reasons
                I have stated above I think the earliest date would still be 1953.

            <p>
                After 1963: The conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode Six about if Henryk can ever die takes place.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1963: Henryk and his daughter also make perogies and the conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode 
                Sixteen about when Henryk fell from the sky happens.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                The earliest reasonable point for Henrykâ€™s daughter to be born is 1945 after the end of World War 2. This means that the 
                earliest possible point for Henrykâ€™s granddaughter to be born is 1963 as this would be 18 years after the earliest year 
                Henrykâ€™s daughter is born, though it is likely latter.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Additional for the same reasons this is the earliest point for the conversations seen in episode 6 and 16 as Henrykâ€™s 
                daughter is seen as an adult who is not noticeable old.           
            </p>

            </p> 
            <p>
                The Interviewer is definitely an adult at the time of her interview with Mr Greetings so she must have been born at 
                least 18 years before 2017 when the interview acquired. She is likely much older, but this is the early possibly date.

            <p>
                Around 2012, 2: Henrykâ€™s great-granddaughter is born making Henryk a great-grandfather and Henrykâ€™s daughter a grandmother.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Around 2012, 3: Henrykâ€™s family photo is taken by Henryk.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                We know Henryks Great-Granddaughter was still a baby around 1 to 3 years old in 2015 as this is the date of the crash, given 
                that the series is believed to be set in 2017 then it would make her 3 years old at youngest and 5 years old at oldest. If 
                she is 5 years old this would also roughly match the appearance of Henrykâ€™s Great-Granddaughter.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Given that The Museum Boy appears the same age as Henrykâ€™s Great-Granddaughter this can be used to approximate his age.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                We see the photo of Henrykâ€™s family has both his daughter and great-granddaughter meaning that Henrykâ€™s daughter must 
                die after Henrykâ€™s Great-Granddaughter was born, given that Henrykâ€™s Great-Granddaughter is still a bay during the 
                crash she this would be about at the similar time.

            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                These events are shown to happen in quick succession in Episode 20 of Interfaces, so they likely happen on the same day.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henrykâ€™s 
                abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
                to when the home was abandoned.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                I believe that Henryk would have abandoned his home Immediately after his suicide attempted, as this place is likely painful 
                for him, hence him abandoning it.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                This also makes sense with Henrykâ€™s daughter as she is shown as a baby in episode 20 and a young child 7 at most through 
                the series which is set in about 2017 making her likely 2-3 years old during the crash and 4-5 years old in the show.

            </p> 
            <p>
                Mischief and The Chef are shown to have been friends before episode 9 so they must have become friends sometime before 2017.

            </p> 
            <p>
                We see in the scenes of KAMIâ€™s programming from episode 18, that she has data from The Wind but has not captured him. 
                This is never greatly elaborated upon so this would be my best gusset.

                This advert is seen running in 2017 so this implies that the advert was made before that.

                9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
                fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
            </p> 
            <p>
                A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
            </p> 
            <p>
                In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.

                The events of this episode are much more surrealist than normal, yet this episode is set in 1911 at the latest which is 
                well before The Philadelphia experiment. This is easily explained by this being a dream of Mischief past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where the dream would take places in the timeline is less clear but itâ€™s likely some point in 2017 and Iâ€™m putting it 
                here as this is in line with the episode order. A more likely point for this to take places is during episode 19 well 
                Henryk sleeps, though it is not confirmed if Mischief sleep at that point or not.
