                uses this to create a digital afterlife for people to live in a simulation of the real world presumably before 1943 and 
                The Philadelphia Experiment.

                1910: Henryk is born.      
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                This is seen on Henryk’s medical record and directly confirmed by Mischief in Episode 8.          
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                Before 1943, 1: Henryk dies accidentally in an nuclear bomb test he was hired to photograph.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Before 1943, 2: Henryk drifts down from the sky in his parachute and meets his wife for the first time, she is working 
                as a nurse at the hospital he is in.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Henryk is implied to have transformed and regained his physicality during the scene we see in Episode 16 of Henryk falling 
                from the sky in his parachute. As the sky is still blue both events must accrue before The Philadelphia Experiment 
                as this noticeable changed the colour of most thing including the sky.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Noticeablely, the first known nuclear bomb test happens on July 16th, 1945, two years after the latest date this could have 
                taken place. This may imply there is a differences nuclear bomb development in the Interfaces universe which could also 
                be implied by the blast evidently being significantly larger than expected resulting in Henryk’s death.             
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                After 1945, 1: Henryk plants a tree with his pregnant partner             
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 2: Henryk’s daughter is born, and Henryk becomes a father             
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1945, 3: Henryk marries his wife.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                During Episode 16 we see the tree being planted that is shown in the photo of their wedding. As his wife is not visibly pregnant 
                during the wedding and after the tree has grown, this implies that Henryk’s daughter was born before they were married.            
            </p>
            <br> 
    
            <p>
                After 1953, 1: Henryk’s Wife died from an unknown illness            
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1953, 2: Henryk attendees his wife’s funeral with his 
                daughter and the paster who is hosting the funeral, is noticeably freak out by his apparent agelessness.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification             
            </p> 
            <p>
                Henryks daughter mentions in episode 6 that her mom died when she was young but clearly remember details of 
                her funeral and other stories her mom shared with her implying, she was at lest 8 years old as this is the age 
                children usually develop their long-term memory.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Given that Henryk appeared young enough to be noticeable weird it is implied that this likely happened closer 
                to 1963 or 1973 as Henryk would only be 43 in 1953 so looking young would not be weird, however for the reasons
                I have stated above I think the earliest date would still be 1953.           
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                After 1963: Henryk’s Granddaughter or Grandson is born making him a Grandfather and making Henryk’s daughter a mother.             
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1963: The conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode Six about if Henryk can ever die takes place.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                After 1963: Henryk and his daughter also make perogies and the conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode 
                Sixteen about when Henryk fell from the sky happens.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification           
            </p> 
            <p>
                The earliest reasonable point for Henryk’s daughter to be born is 1945 after the end of World War 2. This means that the 
                earliest possible point for Henryk’s granddaughter to be born is 1963 as this would be 18 years after the earliest year 
                Henryk’s daughter is born, though it is likely latter.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Additional for the same reasons this is the earliest point for the conversations seen in episode 6 and 16 as Henryk’s 
                daughter is seen as an adult who is not noticeable old.           
            </p> 
            <br>

            <p>
                Around 2012, 2: Henryk’s great-granddaughter is born making Henryk a great-grandfather and Henryk’s daughter a grandmother.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Around 2012, 3: Henryk’s family photo is taken by Henryk.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                We know Henryks Great-Granddaughter was still a baby around 1 to 3 years old in 2015 as this is the date of the crash, given 
                that the series is believed to be set in 2017 then it would make her 3 years old at youngest and 5 years old at oldest. If 
                she is 5 years old this would also roughly match the appearance of Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter.            
            </p> 
            <p>
                Given that The Museum Boy appears the same age as Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter this can be used to approximate his age.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                We see the photo of Henryk’s family has both his daughter and great-granddaughter meaning that Henryk’s daughter must 
                die after Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter was born, given that Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter is still a bay during the 
                crash she this would be about at the similar time.           
            </p>

                2015, EP20, 1: Henryks’ daughter dies of old age and becomes The Ghost.

                2015, EP20, 2: Mischief slivers through the woods.

            <p>
                2015, EP20, 3: After watching his daughter die Henryk attempts suicide by walking out into traffic. either Henryk’s

            </p> 
            <p>
                2015, EP20, 6: The cerebral electricity of Henryk’s dead family is consumed by Mischief.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                2015, EP20, 7: Henryk Abandons his home, prsumeble out of gult.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                Justification            
            </p> 
            <p>
                These events are shown to happen in quick succession in Episode 20 of Interfaces, so they likely happen on the same day.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henryk’s 
                abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
                to when the home was abandoned.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                I believe that Henryk would have abandoned his home Immediately after his suicide attempted, as this place is likely painful 
                for him, hence him abandoning it.           
            </p> 
            <p>
                This also makes sense with Henryk’s daughter as she is shown as a baby in episode 20 and a young child 7 at most through 
                the series which is set in about 2017 making her likely 2-3 years old during the crash and 4-5 years old in the show.           
            </p>

            <p>
                9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
                fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
            </p> 
            <p>
                A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
            </p> 
            <p>
                In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
            </p>

                    My theory would be that the woman is Henryk’s grandchild. The only evidence I have for this theory is that 
                    both Henryk’s daughter and his great-granddaughter are female so this would match the pattern, obviously this 
                    is not really proof but I think it would make the most narrative sense.

        <b>
            Henryk Is Polish  
        </b>
        <p>
            Henryk is likely polish or from a polish family. His family are known to cock perogies and his name is polish. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the importance of World War 2 in the series this could imply that Henryk was one of the many refugees created by 
            the Nazi invasion of Poland. This is not conferred or disproven by the series so far.

                    We see Henryk in the road before the crash and then it cuts to white, there is not enough spaces or time available for the 
                    car to turn into the river like we see it did.

                    This implies a part of his powers may be protecting him from harm in whatever way is possible. In this case I believe that 
                    Henryk realised a large amount of Cerebral Electricity and blow the car of the road, this is also supported by the fact we 
                    see a lot of Cerebral Electricity on the bridge after the crash. In episode 13 we see Henryk perfectly land after a fall 
                    which could be a much smaller use of this power.

        <b>Henryks Death Is Very Complicated</b>
        <p>
            During one scene from episode 23 we see Henryk getting blasted by a nuke casing him to die before getting covered with Cerebral 
            Electricity and reviving. 
             
        </p>
        <p>
            This would seemingly imply that Henryk died to a nuclear blast, but we also know that Henryk was transformed when the sky’s 
            where still blue, meaning before 1943. 
 
        </p> 
        <p>
            This is odd as the first nuke was detonated in 1945, meaning that unless the events of when the skies where still blue are 
            before Henryk’s transformation Henryk dying to a nuke seemingly cannot be true.

        </p>
        <p>
            The most likely conclusion is that this is a small continuity error and that UMAMI did not realize that the first bomb test 
            was 1945 but I think this could also imply that in the interfaces universe the early nuclear bomb testes where more 
            successful than in our universe. 

        </p>  
        <p>
            This could be explained by the presents of cerebral electricity in Interface if cerebral electricity or water weas 
            used to power The Philadelphia Experiment was used instead of uranium this could explain how the development of nuclear 
            blasts was quicker in Interface.

        </p>
        <p>
            Amusing the bomb was seemingly powered by cerebral electricity would also explain how Henryk became a Cerebral Electricity 
            Monster before The Philadelphia Experiment, as well as why the nuclear blast was likely bigger than the military expected.

        </p>   
        <p>
            Henryk transformation into a cerebral electricity monster prior to the Philadelphia experiment is not a contradiction 
            as ghost stories and superstitions are explained to have always been a result of cerebral electricity but where only 
            provable after the experiment acquired.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the nuclear blast was larger than the military expected because of Henryk’s death the military wouldn’t 
            tell Henryk to go somewhere they know he would die the only explanation is that they didn’t think the blast would be as 
            big as it was. This may add to the evidence that the material used for bomb wasn’t uranium but something related to 
            cerebral electricity.

        </p> 
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            A crazier theory for Henryk somehow dying to a nuke years before they were made is that Henryk may have  time travelled after his 
            death, he appears out of nowhere in episode 16 and this is the simplest explanation for this seaming continuity error additionally 
            Cerebral electricity is shown to be able to effect time, as we see The Wind can freeze time, all that being said this is pretty 
            blatantly not intended.

            <b>Henryk Represents The Son of Man</b>
            <p>
                Henryk is clearly meant to represent The Son of Man in the show.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I believe there is a correlation between the apparent boringness of the original Son of Man with Henryk also seeming boring 
                at first glance. In both cases it is not the appearance of the man that is meant to be interesting but the hidden details 
                that are only hinted at in the original work. This could be supported by the chose to make Henryk a silent protagonist which 
                makes him much more mysterious.
            </p> 
            <p>
                In short Henryk being represented by The Son of Man is a metaphor representing that Henryk is a lot more important and interesting
                 than he first appears.

    <b>
        Analysis of The Ghost 
    </b>
    <br><br>

    <b>The Ghosts Deal with Mischief  </b>
    <p>
        The Ghost requests that Mischief brings Henryk back to how he used to be, presumably meaning when he was less depressed. She also commands
        that Mischief informs Henryk of his grate-granddaughters survival.
    </p>
    <p>
        In exchange for this Mischief will receive all that perish, the meaning of this is not entirely clear but it seems more than likely that
        this refers to the cerebral electricity in the interface, the interfaces is a form of digital afterlife that “all that perish” will 
        presumably go to. 

    </p> 
    <p>
        This would also explain The Ghost’s actions in episode 4 as she shows no resistance to being absorbed to the Greetings Robotics system.
        This appears odd in the series be could be explained by this being a part of their deal.

    </p>
    <p>
        Mischief mentions in Episode 24 that he was worried about the consequences of Henryk not waking up this may imply that there are 
        established consequences of breaking the deal that are not made clear in the series. Additionally, it is possible that this would 
        only result in him not getting what The Ghost promised him.

    </p> 
    <p>
        Mischief likely could not have beaten The Mechanical Saccorhytus without being consumed by him and corrupting him, which is odd 
        considering that The Mechanical Saccorhytus seams to be made with the intent of being able to absorb large amounts of cerebral 
        electricity so Mischief should not be able to corrupt him. This leads me to believe that as part of their deal when Henryk and 
        his greet-granddaughter are reunited she will somehow disable whatever was protecting The Mechanical Saccorhytus to allow Mischief
        to consume the Cerebral Electricity from The Interface.         

    </p> 
    <br><br> 

   
    <b>Shiva Comparison </b>
    <p>
        The Ghost is compared to a Hindu goddess called shiva by Greetings Robotics.
    </p>  
    <p>
        I believe that the origine of this is form the quote, “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed; a few people cried.
        Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that 
        he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multiarmed form and says, ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I 
        suppose we all thought that, one way or another.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        This quote is highly relevant to the series as it is about the change to the world after the creation of nuclear bombs, which 
        allegorically relates to interfaces which is about the changes to the world after the discovery of cerebral electricity.
    </p>   
    <p>
        From what I have read Shiva is a different form of Vishnu and another god called Rudra. Noticeably all these gods are portrayed as having 
        multiple arms which relates to The Ghost as she has many hands.
    </p>   
    <br><br>

    <b>Analysis of Henryk Presumed Granddaughter </b>
    <br><br>    

    <b>Possible Relation To KAMI</b>
    <p>
       Henryk’s Presumed Granddaughter has a strong physical resemblance to KAMI which would lead some to believe that she has connection to her.
    </p>  
    <p>
       The only connection that would make sense is that she was made using Henryk’s Presumed Granddaughter, but this is impossible as we know her cerebral electricity has consumed by Mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
       The meta reason for this was likely a reused asset.
    </p>   
 
    <br><br>

    <b>Analysis of Henryk’s Greet- Granddaughter</b>
    <br><br>    

    <b>Is She a Willing Hostage </b>
    <p>
        In Episode 21 she is shown to be much happier as her old apartment building is restored, she then walks away and is seemingly greeted by 
        The Ghost, this seemingly implies she was tricked by Greetings Robotics into thinking that The Ghost was willingly working with them.
    </p>  
    <p>
        However in episode 24 she is clearly uncomfortable and runs away as soon as possible so she has likely figured out that this was only a 
        copy of The Ghost being used by Greetings Robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I am right about her having been tricked, she would not be a willing hostage but would have likely gone with them willingly at first.
