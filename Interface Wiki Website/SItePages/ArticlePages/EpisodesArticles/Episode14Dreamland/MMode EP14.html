                    Sunflower. During the scene with Proto-Mischief and the Sunflower The Ringmaster continues his monologue saying that 
                    whatever they think they can’t be sure as death takes many forms.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>
            <b>
                Dreamland or Foolish House    
            </b>
            <p>
                There is some confusion on whether the venue they are at is called Dreamland or Foolish House, the answer is actual 
                both. In the episode the building clearly has a big sign out front saying Foolish House which would imply it is the 
                name of the business, but The Ringmaster says they are at Dreamland as well as the episode being called that, so 
                this is naturally confusing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, there is a simple explanation Dreamland is the name of an amusement park that Foolish House is located 
                in. Dreamland is actual a real-life theme park that was located on Cony Island, New York until it burned down in 1911. 
                This is directly confirmed by Umami in the description of the episode.           
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <b>
                Sunflowers Are Mischief, Mischief Is a Dragon, And Dragons Are Death 
            </b>
            <p>
                This episode has what I believe to be a three-layered metaphor about Death, Dragons, Mischief, And Sunflowers I will 
                attempt to explain here.
            </p>
            <i>
                Layer one, death is a dragon
            </i>
            <p>
                When The Ringmaster is giving the fine part of his monolog he clearly corelates the dragon with death, The Ringmaster 
                claims that he saw death in his dream but then the story’s about a dragon and if you listening to the monologue its 
                very clear that the dragon is meant to be a metaphor for death. At an earlier point in the monologue The Ringmaster 
                claims that people may have seen death at the bottom of a bottle, this is another example of a similar metaphor to 
                help prove my point.         
            </p>

            <i>
                Layer two, Mischief is a dragon    
            </i>
            <p>
                Mischief being a dragon is easier to explain and prove, in the end of the episode we see The Ringmaster introduces 
                the dragon he apparently tamed before Proto-Mischief is shown. I believe that only would prove the connection but 
                there is more proof at one point in the monologue The Ringmaster says “That’s when I saw it! It twisted and twirled 
                towards me. I saw Its wicked smile, I heard its wicked laugh!” this is clearly talking about Mischief as he is known 
                to travel in a similar manner and is known to have a sinister smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I believe that Mischief as a dragon still represents death, the part of the monologue that most directly 
                talks about death is as the part that most directly talks about death, the line of the monolog being the line about the 
                dragon twisting and twirling. The way The Ringmaster talks about the dragon makes it seem like his talking about death 
                as a separate entity to the dragon, but the sentence would only really makes sense if he is talking about both. It is 
                important to remember that The Ringmaster is also clearly talking about Mischief, so it only makes sense that Mischief 
                represents both the dragon and death.

            <p>
                Before getting into this episode, I feel it is important to remind you of when Mischief transformed into a sunflower in 
                episode five and says, “I’m a beautiful sunflower”, it doesn’t really get clearer than that but there is more proof of 
                the metaphor in episode fourteen.   
            </p>
            <p>
                In the episode we see a scene where the shot is constantly changing between Proto-Mischief and a sunflower that may 
                imply that the two are being corelated. We also see another scene where we see Proto-Mischief walking down a corridor 
                with his reflection being replaced by a sunflower. Well ever of these two examples could mean nothing on their own it, 
                but taking both metaphors together with the scene from episode five it is a much clearer corelation between sunflowers 
                and Mischief. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This leaves the question of if sunflowers are also meant to corelate to dragons and death my answer yes-ish.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe the dragon analogy purely apples to Mischief in this one scene. Mischief  clearly isn’t a dragon, I think 
                the dragon is just a metaphor for death used in the monologue as a way to avoid directly calling Mischief  death, in 
                simple terms I believe that if Mischief  is not a dragon, is death and Sunflowers are Mischief  then sunflowers must 
                represent death and Mischief  but not dragons.  
            </p>

            <b>
                Proto-Mischief’s Name   
            </b>
            <p>
                When Proto-Mischief is announced on stage his name is said to be Percy, but Proto-Mischief is confused by this 
                clamming to have changed that.
            </p>
            <p>
                To explain this, I think it helps to understand that this episode is implied to be a dream or heavily distorted memory of 
                Mischief post transformation in a cerebral electricity monster, so the events are not literal. Percy was likely the stage 
                name of Proto-Mischief but Mischief remembering or dreaming is confused by this as he has changed his name to Mischief.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, it is possible that Proto-Mischief did actually just change his stage name at some point but for the reasons 
                said above I believe that this is meant to apply to Mischief dreaming of his time as a human.         
            </p>

                        The most common interpretation of the original painting is the jester is morning the loss of a city that had just 
                        been lost to their enemy, this loss possible leading to the doom of the nation. It is important to notice that in 
                        the background there is a party clear being held showing that ironically the only person taking the loss of the city 
                        seriously is the juster.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        I believe that there is a significant chance that this painting is just used for the inspiration of the outfit and pose. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        That being said I do have one interpretation of the painting based on the original meaning of the painting; Mischief 
                        may be morning the loss of his humanity. The original painting clearly shows the clown distraught at the loss of the 
                        city to their enemy which raise the question what would Mischief morning? The easiest answer is that he is morning 
                        the loss of his humanity, this episode is about Mischief ether dreaming or remembering his time as a human, so it 
                        makes sense that if he is sad about this, he may be mentally correlating himself with the painting.                
                    </p>              
                    <p>
                        This would not be the only time that we see a painting used to convey meaning without having to say something aloud 
                        so it would not be odd for this to be how the painting is used to show how Mischief feels.
