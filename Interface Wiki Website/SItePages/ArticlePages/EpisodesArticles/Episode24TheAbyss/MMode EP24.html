                    The episode opens on a vitals monitor connected to Mr Greetings, we see a verity of drugs being administered before a 
                    shot of Mr Greetings is shown with an odd port on his faeces is shown and he hear him flatline.

                    The drug cocktail that is administered is identical to the most common form of lethal injection meaning that this was 
                    likely intentionally done so Mr Greetings could upload his Cerebral Electricity to The Interface.

                    The scene changes and we see inside the lighthouse and see that Mischief has transformed into as dial phone, with Henryk
                    lying on the ground. We hear the Cerebral Electricity motif before Mischief stops ringing and begins to talk to Henryk. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Mischief says that he was worrying about his obligations if Henryk hadn’t woken up, confirming that Henryk is awake despite
                    still laying on the ground. Mischief claims that this reminds him of when Henryk fainted in the museum during episode 6.

                    The scene changes to show the starts as Mischief begins to monologue, quoted directly he says, “When humans first gazed upon 
                    the night, did they see stars? A lung, a heart, a hand, an alter in the sky. What is a constellation, but a sum of its 
                    parts?” “They didn’t see stars, they saw titans.” As Mischief says this, we see The Mechanical Saccorhytus patiently 
                    waiting outside for Henryk to make his chose.

                    The telephone starts ringing again, Henryk picks up Mischief’s phone handle and putting it too his ear and Mischief continues 
                    saying “what came first Henryk the baby chicken or the egg? Man, or God? If man came first, they’ll make God. By doing so they 
                    become one.” During this we see a memory of Henryk riding on a train past his home will a storm builds above the houses.

                    bopping Mischief  red nose, Mischief  proceeds to change into his suit form.  We see Henryk’s daughter and great-grandfather

                        Mischief’s Obligations  
                    </b>   
                    <p>
                        Mischief claims that he was dreading his obligations if Henryk had not awaken but does not specify what he means,
                        I will explain now what I think this means.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think this refers to his deal with The Ghost, Mischief had promised to help Henryk be happy and bring him to 
                        his Grand granddaughter. I believe that Mischief would have ever been focused to fulfil an unspecified condition 
                        of the deal that would have not been pleasant for him or that he simply would not have received his reward, 
                        presumably The Interface.

                        Mischief ’s Star Monolog, Meaning and References  
                    </b>  

                    <p>
                        “When humans first gazed upon the night, did they see stars? A lung, a heart, a hand, an alter in the sky. 
                        What is a constellation, but a sum of its parts?” “They didn’t see stars, they saw titans.”                     
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This reflects a common theme of the series that reality is largely based on perception. This line may also 
                        provide a parallel to how Cerebral Electricity works.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        I believe that there is a double meaning for “Did they see stars? A lung, a heart, a hand, an alter in the sky” 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This is a reference in this line which references some of the characters in the series, as shown in episode 18 
                        Lung references to The Wind, Heart references to The Chef, and Hand references to The Ghost.                   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stars likely refers to Cerebral Electricity as a whole, this conversation refers to constellations which are 
                        largely based on people perception of the sky, similar to Cerebral Electricity Monster who are pure Cerebral 
                        Electricity which is being filtered through somebody’s perception of the world, hence their differences in ability
                        and KAMI needing to absorb the Cerebral Electricity of others to gain there powers.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The Alter may refer KAMI as she kills a verity of Cerebral Electricity Monster to gain their powers and alters are 
                        commonly associated with the concept of sacrifice.                     
                    </p>  
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        The telephone starts ringing again as Mischief continues saying “What came first Henryk the baby chicken or the 
                        egg? Man, or God? If man came first, they’ll make God. By doing so they become one.”
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This still relates to the concept of reality being filtered through perception. Essentially, I believe this question
                        is saying what came first reality or human’s perception of it, though this don’t perfectly map to some of the over lines.
                    </p>

                        “Every choice we make is a sacrifice. Nothing will stop them. And thus, there never was a choice at all. So, it follows, 
                        of your choices is an illusion, so too is your sacrifice.”

                    <p>
                        This is essentially denying that humans do not have choices or freewill, as we never really have a chose, so we never 
                        really decide anything. This is usually based in the hypothesis that a human’s behaver is entirely predictable if you 
                        can predict ever verbal involved, whoever this is impossible to test as there is no way to perfectly account for every 
                        variable effecting somebody.

                    <p>
                        This is Mischief way of asking KAMI what her perspective of the world is and claiming that she cannot see or understand 
                        her own existence.

                    <p>
                        We see that KAMI is impersonating The Ghost in some of the scenes here as well as taking actions we know that The 
                        Ghost Never would like threatening Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter with a knife. This leads me to believe that when a 
                        creature is consumed by Greetings Robotics, they are basically dead and only their forms and memories remain to be 
                        used as they please regardless of what the person would want.

                        Apples            
                    </b>  
                    <p>
                        In this episode we see Henryk raiser an apple obscuring his faces before launching at KAMI, and at a different 
                        point we see Mischief transform into an apple to be consumed by The Mechanical Saccorhytus. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        I believe that in both scenes the apple is meant to represent desires. In the first scene we could see this as 
                        Henryk embracing and understanding his desires, him know speaking to be happy and embraces the progressing world.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        In the second scene it would represent Mischief desire to infiltrate the Interfaces which is seemingly the motive 
                        for doing what he does through the series, especially in regard to his deal with The Ghost. This could also be 
                        because of the desire of The Mechanical Saccorhytus as he is shown as incredible glutens and hungry a 
                        simple desire but a desire non the less.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This would correlate to the uses of apples at other points in the series as well most noticeable in The Son of Man 
                        where a similar metaphor is used. The son of an is also likely a reference in of itself as this painting is frequently 
                        referenced throughout the show.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Additional for Mischief the idea of a poisoned apple is common in media going back to story’s like sleeping beauty, 
                        there is also the idea of worms infesting apples which is a common theme in media worms are a form that Mischief 
                        commonly takes, so this could mean to imitate this symbolism.

                            The poem is also commonly used by sobriety groups as a call for privacy and the protection of anonymity. This likely 
                            doesn’t correlate but given that KAMI is made of other people’s memories there a chance this is meant to represent 
                            their memories being destroyed, this is not likely but possible.

                            It is not clear what Mischief was doing to KAMI before her destruction, but it is likely that it led to the creation 
                            of The Oni the creature we see in the new short called the condemnation.

                            From what we see in the series Cerebral Electricity Monsters are created when a creature is turned into pure Cerebral 
                            Electrically and dies before being able to return to normal, given that KAMI is made of near pure Cerebral Electricity
                            and she dose die in this episode it is possible she was reborn as a Cerebral Electricity Monsters, which would 
                            explain The Oni’s similarities to KAMI.

                        <p>
                            Additionally, The Oni may have been an early captured Cerebral Electricity Monsters that was used for the creation of 
                            KAMI which would explain where the SHIVA liberty came from, there is no evidence for this in the episode but it is the 
                            only over explanation for their similarities to KAMI so it’s worth noting.

                            The sister series to Interfaces, Safe Mode takes places during the last few minutes of Interface as Mischief infects the 
                            Interface via The Mechanical Saccorhytus. Safe Mode clearly establishes that The Interfaces spend so time in safe mode 
                            before ever removing Mischief or succumbing and being destroyed. However, given what we have seen in the post credit-scene
                            it is not clear if Mischief will succeed in consuming the interfaces aka all the perish. (accurate as of 18/07/24)

                        Meny of René Magritte’s paintings include a theme of reality being filtered through the eye of the perceiver 
                        which is also true in The Son of Man.

                    <p>
                        This heavily correlated with the main theme of Mischifes monologue which implies that choice is an illusion 
                        based in the perception of the individual. more specifically their lack of an ability for people to 
                        understand what drives them.

                        This was a painting made in 1942 by Edward Hopper, it was intended to be a portrayal of an American city in 1942 but the 
                        writer admitted that they accidentally captured the loneliness of modern cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe this painting is meant to represent Henryk embracing the modern world with his granddaughter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At first this scene may seem depressing but in ever version there is no actual cause for loneliness the characters are 
                        surrounded by people and in the show, we see Henryk is with his daughter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Compering the dark and cold outside to the light and presumably warm interior of the dinner could imply that Henryk 
                        is literally turning his back to the dark parts of his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, this is directly confirmed the boy in the background shares a strong resemblance to The Museum Boy, I think this is the case as in the original picture a man and who is 
                        probably his girlfriend is shown, which would make this an odd change to be made for no reason.
                        <br><br>
                        This could help to support the interpretation that this uses of the painting is more positive than it may first appear as there is a chance for new relationships here practically 
                        with Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter who seems about the same age as The Museum Boy.
