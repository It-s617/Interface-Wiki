                        This was the year that Mischief presumably stopped being a comedian and an acter, this would be because of the fire 
                        that burned down dreamland, acquiring in 1911. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        It is not clear what the cause of the fire was in the show, in real life we know it was an accident caused by pore 
                        fire safety and regulations not directly blameable on anybody. However, in the show Proto-Mischief and The Ringmaster 
                        are implied to have had something to do with it, possibly over drama with The Foolish Girl. Too be clear this is only 
                        ever implied by the show and never confirmed or directly shown.

                        When he says 54 years to soon, he is referring to the painting Two Comedians which was painted in 1965, by Edward 
                        Hopper, as his final painting and goodbye.

                        Mischief says "1943. Employers shot me down. I've already told you that one." And a scene is shown of Henryk 
                        climbing the stairs is shown before a shot 
                        of Mischief looking into camera is shown.

                    <p>
                        This is referring to The Philadelphia Experiment when Mischief transformed into a Cerebral Electricity 
                        Monster before being shot down by the military.

                        Mischief says "1946. The demon core struck twice. Will it strike once more?" Henryk is seen to reach the top 
                        of the lighthouse and see a column of Cerebral Electricity.
                    </i>  
                    <p>
                        This refers to an event in 1946 where there were two accidents caused by an unexploded nuclear core called 
                        “The Demon Core” which emitted a large amount of radiation killing two people.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        It is not clear what the third strike is meant to represents but it is clear that it’s meant to represent 
                        a possible coming disaster.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        One possible meaning of this could be KAMI’s planed attack on Henryk and Mischief, the first two strikes 
                        of the demon core would be her absorbing The Ghost and The Chef, with the third possible strike being her 
                        planed attack on the duo.

                        Mischief says "1954. The apple was a ruse." A shot of an apple falling before shattering into Cerebral 
                        Electricity is shown. 
                    </i>  
                    <p>
                        This refers to the death of Alan Turing in 1954 he was a prominent computer scientists and war hero. 
                        Some believe that his death has caused by him having been assassinated by a poisoned apple or that he killed 
                        himself with the same apple, though this is widely believed to be false as it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The most likely answers to his death in the real world was an accident he was experimenting with cyanide and 
                        if he consumed even a little by accident he would have died. It is worth noting that next to no research was 
                        done on the body of Alan Turing was done so it is hard to confirm for sure what killed him, and it is entirely 
                        possible his death was nothing to do with cyanide or the apple.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        It is unclear what this is meant to mean in the series, but it likely has something to do with the painting 
                        called The Son of Man meaning the apple hiding The Son of Man is a lie.          
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The son of man in the show is likely meant to refer to two things Mischief not understanding Henryk’s desires 
                        and the importance of the next generation.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        This line makes more scenes when applied to the first meaning we know that Mischief always intended to bring 
                        Henryk to Henryk’s great-granddaughter as this was a part of his deal with The Ghost, so the ruse was 
                        presumably referring to Mischief tricking Henryk as he tried to get to know him better.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The importance of the next generation doesn’t apply as well in this scene but could refer to the importance 
                        of progress for all generations not just the news generation.         
                    </p>

                        Mischief says "1961. My soul, where are you? I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude." Henryk is 
                        shown to touch the column before faces appear in the Cerebral Electricity.

                    <p>
                        This references the red book in 1961 by Carl Jung the book heavily focuses on the importance of 
                        self-realisation. Which seems to be an important concept to Mischief.
