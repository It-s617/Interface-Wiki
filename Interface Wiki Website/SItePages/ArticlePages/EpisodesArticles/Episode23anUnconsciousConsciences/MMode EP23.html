                    the back, he will only see his past offering to show him his futter if he turns round but Henryk refuses as he is 
                    only interested in his past.

                    behind him. during this scene Mr Greetings asks Henryk what the cause of his dissociation is and tells Henryk he

                    Burning Cigarette, by Vincent van Gogh. During this scene Mr Greetings says to Henryk that all hunted souls remain on 
                    earth because they cannot leave, presumably speaking hyperbolically meaning they are too upset or obsessed to move on. 
                    He then asks Henryk why he didn’t leave, as we see Henryk’s flesh return.

                    Henryk he’s changed, as he finishes, we see a shot of KAMI inside the twin towers bowing as then a plane collides with the building.

                        already transformed when the sky’s where still blue, meaning before 1943 and the first nuke was detonated in 1945 
                        meaning that unless the events of when the skies where still blue are before Henryk’s transformation this cannot be true.

                        Mr Greeting the then claims the man of the past is responsible for several thing which I will list and explain below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This likely refers to how Mr Greetings believes that humanity and Cerebral Electricity Monsters are essentially 
                        at war which was largely ignored for years.

                    <p>
                        Is likely referring to the advancement of weapons technology, with stuff like nuclear weapons and KAMI being made.

                    <p>
                        This is likely referring to the advancement of society after World War Two and how nature was increasingly abandoned.
                    </p>

                        The Ghost is seaming trying to convince Henryk to stay in the interfaces at the cost of Mischief freedom, but it is not 
                        clear if she has freewill at the time as she has been absorbed by KAMI.

                        I do not believe this is even The Ghost in the scene as KAMI is shown to be impersonating her in the final episode, and 
                        she has all the information she would need as she should be able to remember everything The Ghost remembers after 
                        absorbing her Cerebral Electricity.

                        Henryk is seen looking at the photo of his family and the photo given to him by Mischief of The Wind. This was 
                        likely to remind Henryk of The Winds warning not to get lost in time.

                        This painting is inspired by a poem by Roy Campbell “I scorn the goose-step of their massed attack
                        And fight with my guitar slung on my back, against a regiment I oppose a brain and a dark horse against an armoured train.”.

                        The main feature of this painting is the juxtaposition of the horse and the armoured train with the train clearly outmatching

                        Well, the original use of the painting was to represent Henryk as the man of the past being passed by modern technology, in 
                        this case It is obvious that the horse represents Mischief and progress. The old train representing the past Mr Greetings 
                        serves and the horses representing the new world created by Cerebral Electricity.

                        Golconda was meant to represent how paintings are false reality of their subjects and can be used in a deceptive manner.

                        This painting was made by Vladimir Kush in 1996 it represents the creation of new life with a verity of different 
                        artistic metaphors like the yolk and the sun. This work is similar to Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of
