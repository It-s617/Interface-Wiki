                        there is another motive that he is not revealing?

                    was present for the test as a new recruit to the US military. As she discusses this a newspaper is shown from the 
                    immediate aftermath of The Philadelphia Experiment it makes it clear that the public was immediately aware of the 
                    paradigm shift as well as confirming The Philadelphia Experiment took Places on the USS Eldridge.

                    A scene of The Museum Boy planting some sunflowers, before The Interviewer begins to discuss the people who were born after 
                    1943 and have only experienced the world as it is. Mr Greetings begins to explain the difficulty of explaining the differences 
                    between the world before and after The Philadelphia Experiment to people who did not see the way the world was before. He 
                    claims that The Philadelphia Experiment, made much more things visible to people. Mr Greetings claims to believe that 
                    something like The Philadelphia Experiment was inevitable was unavoidable and comperes’ Cerebral Electricity to force 
                    like nuclear power, the ozone, and climate change.

                    <b>
                        Sunflowers
                    </b>  
                    <p>
                        We see The Museum Boy growing a sunflower before seeing it fall out The Window well, he is watching the interview with 
                        Mr Greetings. I believe that the metaphor’s specified in dreamland apply here and gives the scene a deeper meaning, 
                        which I will explained here.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The metaphor in Episode 14 Dreamland was that Mischief represents death and sunflowers represent both Mischief and death. 
                        Mischief has also been shown to represent the future and the next generation as shown in “bear wittiness” where he is 
                        compered to The New Man, who is literally the generation following the year 1943.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The first scene shows The Museum Boy being interested in growing the sunflower, I believe that this is meant to show that 
                        the boy is interested in the future and the progress of the world as said above this is what Mischief represents and 
                        sunflowers are represents Mischief.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        The second scene shows The Museum Boy watching the Mr Greetings interview as the sunflower falls out of The Window. 
                        I believe that this is meant to show that the boy losses interest in the future because of what Mr Greetings is saying 
                        in the interview, this is lily what Mr Greetings intends due to his sole goal being to take the world back to the way 
                        it was before 1943.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I believe that this scene could also be about death, in dreamland this is implied to be something that 
                        Mischief represents. So, the scene where he grows the sunflower would represent him expecting death in his life and 
                        the scene where the sunflower falls would represent him rejecting death. This makes some sense as The Interface is 
                        shown to be a form of digital afterlife meaning that Mr Greetings has essentially ended death in the world.

                        The original painting was meant to depict Satan’s fall from heaven after he was banished by God for being sinful and 
                        impure. It may be important to remember that Christians consider the first sine to have been the knowledge of good an evil.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        I believe that this painting was meant to depict that Mischief has gain a higher level of understanding of the universe 
                        and lost his “purity”. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        This would correlate to what we see in “bear witness” as the egg is often used as a symbol of purity in Christion art 
                        and Mischief is seen breaking through the egg which could imply that his transformation made him impure in some ways.
