            <p>
                Mr Greetings appears to be a regular elderly human, but it is clear from episode 21 that Mr Greetings is no longer human as he 
                would have been transformed into a cerebral electricity monster, noticeable he has seemingly maintained his human appearance and 
                it is not clear if he got any powers form this.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than this he likely only has the abilities of an old man.

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the timeline of The Mechanical Saccorhytus in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>
            </p>

        <p>
            Before 1925: Mr Greetings are born.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Mr Greetings must have been born at least 18 years before joining the military so the earliest 
            possible date for him being born is 1925, it is possible they were born before this.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            1943, 1: The Philadelphia Experiment accusers teleporting the USS Eldridge to New York from Philadelphia.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 2: Mr Greetings is turned into pure cerebral electricity before rematerializing slightly above the USS Eldridge. 
            Seemingly unharmed and uncharged.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 3: Mr Greetings watches many of the solders aboard the USS Eldridge die after being fussed to the hull of the ship.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 4: Mischief says boo to Mr Greeting before leaving.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            The events of The Philadelphia Experiment is repeatedly mentioned to have taken places in 1943.            
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            After 1945, 1: Greetings Robotics is founded by Mr Greetings.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1945, 2: The Mechanical Saccorhytus is bult by Greetings Robotics presumably ordered by Mr Greetings.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We do not get much information on when Greetings Robotics was founded but it can be assumed that this was shortly after 
            World War 2 as Mr Greeting is a very well-known and established person in The Interfaces world which would imply that he 
            has been actively working for quite some time.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            It is easy to assume that The Mechanical Saccorhytus was more likely bult during the 2000s but we do not get any information
            on when it was bult or unveiled so all I can say for sure is that it was bult after World War 2. Additionally, it is possible
            that the blimp was originally made earlier, and latter modified into The Mechanical Saccorhytus.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            Before 2017: The Wind is scanned by Greetings Robotics, or they somehow partially capture him.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            We see in the scenes of KAMI’s programming from episode 18, that she has data from The Wind but has not captured him. 
            This is never greatly elaborated upon so this would be my best gusset.
        </p> 

        <p>
           2017, 1: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

        <p>
            2017, EP24, 1: While onboard The Mechanical Saccorhytus, Mr Greetings executes himself to be permanently uploaded to The Interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Justification
        </p>
        <p>
            This may happen concurrently with Episode 23 or slightly after, as we know Mr Greetings was in the interface to talk to 
            Henryk during Episode 23 but he may have bean able to visit the interface without dying like Henryk did.

            <b>Mr Greetings Represents the Past</b>
            <p>
               I believe that both Henryk and Mr Greetings represent the past, I believe that Mr Greetings is meant to represent the old people in 
               the world that refuse to except that the world has moved on from when they were young and are scared of the new world.
            </p>
            <p>
               This is pretty clear throughout the series especially in Episode 21 Restoration where Mr Greetings admits that a lot of people born 
               after 1943 don’t think there’s anything wrong with the new world and don’t understand what the past was like. 
            </p>

            <b>Unclear Personal Details</b>
            <br>

            <i>
                Species: Unclear
            </i>
            <p>
                Mr Greetings appear to be a regular human being but we see in episode 21 restoration that during the Philadelphia Experiment that 
                he was transformed into pure cerebral electricity and transformed back into his original form. This would seemingly imply that he 
                is no longer purely human but it is not completely clear.
