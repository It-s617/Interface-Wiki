            <b>Physical Appearance</b>
            <p>
                Henryk appears as a middle-aged man with red hair and moustache, nearly always seen in a blue suit and bowler hat.
            </p>

            <b>Personality </b>
            <p>
                Henryk appears to be depressed, quiet, and contemplative, never speaking in the Interface series. It is clear from his actions 
                that more than everything he cares for his family and feels intense guilt for accidently killing his grandchild and their partner.

            <h2>Powers And Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                Henryk is capable of doing anything a normal middle-aged man would be able to do, but he may also have additional powers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Henryks powers seam to give him a form of incorrigibility, which means an inability to change. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Mer greetings is also a humanoid cerebral electricity monster but is seen to age while Henryk doesn’t age and cannot seemingly be 
                injured as seen in episode 20 where it seams like he must have accidentally blown away the car he was trying to get hit by, 
                additional in episode 13 we see that Henryk perfectly land after falling of a unicycle which leads me to believe Henryk’s powers 
                protect him from any significant physical change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Henryk is seaming capable of generating infinite cigarettes. This is commented on by Mischief in episode 13, this may imply that 
                Henryk may have a similar power to create things, like how The Ghost can make hands.

            <h2>Personal Timeline </h2>

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the events of Henryk’s Life in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>
            </p>   

        <br><br>

        <p>
            1910: Henryk is born.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            This is seen on Henryk’s medical record and directly confirmed by Mischief in Episode 8.          
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            Before 1943, 1: Henryk dies accidentally in an nuclear bomb test he was hired to photograph.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Before 1943, 2: Henryk drifts down from the sky in his parachute and meets his wife for the first time, she is working 
            as a nurse at the hospital he is in.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Henryk is implied to have transformed and regained his physicality during the scene we see in Episode 16 of Henryk falling 
            from the sky in his parachute. As the sky is still blue both events must accrue before The Philadelphia Experiment 
            as this noticeable changed the colour of most thing including the sky.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Noticeablely, the first known nuclear bomb test happens on July 16th, 1945, two years after the latest date this could have 
            taken place. This may imply there is a differences nuclear bomb development in the Interfaces universe which could also 
            be implied by the blast evidently being significantly larger than expected resulting in Henryk’s death.             
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            After 1945, 1: Henryk plants a tree with his pregnant partner             
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1945, 2: Henryk’s daughter is born, and Henryk becomes a father             
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1945, 3: Henryk marries his wife.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            During Episode 16 we see the tree being planted that is shown in the photo of their wedding. As his wife is not visibly pregnant 
            during the wedding and after the tree has grown, this implies that Henryk’s daughter was born before they were married.            
        </p>
        <br> 

        <p>
            After 1953, 1: Henryk’s Wife died from an unknown illness            
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1953, 2: Henryk attendees his wife’s funeral with his 
            daughter and the paster who is hosting the funeral, is noticeably freak out by his apparent agelessness.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Henryks daughter mentions in episode 6 that her mom died when she was young but clearly remember details of 
            her funeral and other stories her mom shared with her implying, she was at lest 8 years old as this is the age 
            children usually develop their long-term memory.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Given that Henryk appeared young enough to be noticeable weird it is implied that this likely happened closer 
            to 1963 or 1973 as Henryk would only be 43 in 1953 so looking young would not be weird, however for the reasons
            I have stated above I think the earliest date would still be 1953.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            After 1963: Henryk’s Granddaughter or Grandson is born making him a Grandfather and making Henryk’s daughter a mother.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1963: The conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode Six about if Henryk can ever die takes place.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1963: Henryk and his daughter also make perogies and the conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode 
            Sixteen about when Henryk fell from the sky happens.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            The earliest reasonable point for Henryk’s daughter to be born is 1945 after the end of World War 2. This means that the 
            earliest possible point for Henryk’s granddaughter to be born is 1963 as this would be 18 years after the earliest year 
            Henryk’s daughter is born, though it is likely latter.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Additional for the same reasons this is the earliest point for the conversations seen in episode 6 and 16 as Henryk’s 
            daughter is seen as an adult who is not noticeable old.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            Around 2012, 2: Henryk’s great-granddaughter is born making Henryk a great-grandfather and Henryk’s daughter a grandmother.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Around 2012, 3: Henryk’s family photo is taken by Henryk.

            We know Henryks Great-Granddaughter was still a baby around 1 to 3 years old in 2015 as this is the date of the crash, given 
            that the series is believed to be set in 2017 then it would make her 3 years old at youngest and 5 years old at oldest. If 
            she is 5 years old this would also roughly match the appearance of Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Given that The Museum Boy appears the same age as Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter this can be used to approximate his age.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            We see the photo of Henryk’s family has both his daughter and great-granddaughter meaning that Henryk’s daughter must 
            die after Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter was born, given that Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter is still a bay during the 
            crash she this would be about at the similar time.

        <p>
            These events are shown to happen in quick succession in Episode 20 of Interfaces, so they likely happen on the same day.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henryk’s 
            abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
            to when the home was abandoned.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            I believe that Henryk would have abandoned his home Immediately after his suicide attempted, as this place is likely painful 
            for him, hence him abandoning it.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            This also makes sense with Henryk’s daughter as she is shown as a baby in episode 20 and a young child 7 at most through 
            the series which is set in about 2017 making her likely 2-3 years old during the crash and 4-5 years old in the show.

        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.

            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            <p>
                Henryk is likely polish or from a polish family. His family are known to cock perogies and his name is polish. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the importance of World War 2 in the series this could imply that Henryk was one of the many refugees created by 
                the Nazi invasion of Poland. This is not conferred or disproven by the series so far.

                        This implies a part of his powers may be protecting him from harm in whatever way is possible. In this case I believe that 
                        Henryk realised a large amount of Cerebral Electricity and blow the car of the road, this is also supported by the fact we 
                        see a lot of Cerebral Electricity on the bridge after the crash. In episode 13 we see Henryk perfectly land after a fall 
                        which could be a much smaller use of this power.

            <b>Henryks Death Is Very Complicated</b>
            <p>
                During one scene from episode 23 we see Henryk getting blasted by a nuke casing him to die before getting covered with Cerebral 
                Electricity and reviving. 
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                This would seemingly imply that Henryk died to a nuclear blast, but we also know that Henryk was transformed when the sky’s 
                where still blue, meaning before 1943. 
     
            </p> 
            <p>
                This is odd as the first nuke was detonated in 1945, meaning that unless the events of when the skies where still blue are 
                before Henryk’s transformation Henryk dying to a nuke seemingly cannot be true.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                The most likely conclusion is that this is a small continuity error and that UMAMI did not realize that the first bomb test 
                was 1945 but I think this could also imply that in the interfaces universe the early nuclear bomb testes where more 
                successful than in our universe. 
    
            </p>  
            <p>
                This could be explained by the presents of cerebral electricity in Interface if cerebral electricity or water weas 
                used to power The Philadelphia Experiment was used instead of uranium this could explain how the development of nuclear 
                blasts was quicker in Interface.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                Amusing the bomb was seemingly powered by cerebral electricity would also explain how Henryk became a Cerebral Electricity 
                Monster before The Philadelphia Experiment, as well as why the nuclear blast was likely bigger than the military expected.
    
            </p>   
            <p>
                Henryk transformation into a cerebral electricity monster prior to the Philadelphia experiment is not a contradiction 
                as ghost stories and superstitions are explained to have always been a result of cerebral electricity but where only 
                provable after the experiment acquired.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the nuclear blast was larger than the military expected because of Henryk’s death the military wouldn’t 
                tell Henryk to go somewhere they know he would die the only explanation is that they didn’t think the blast would be as 
                big as it was. This may add to the evidence that the material used for bomb wasn’t uranium but something related to 
                cerebral electricity.
    
            </p> 
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                A crazier theory for Henryk somehow dying to a nuke years before they were made is that Henryk may have  time travelled after his 
                death, he appears out of nowhere in episode 16 and this is the simplest explanation for this seaming continuity error additionally 
                Cerebral electricity is shown to be able to effect time, as we see The Wind can freeze time, all that being said this is pretty 
                blatantly not intended.

                <b>Henryk Represents The Son of Man</b>
                <p>
                    Henryk is clearly meant to represent The Son of Man in the show.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I believe there is a correlation between the apparent boringness of the original Son of Man with Henryk also seeming boring 
                    at first glance. In both cases it is not the appearance of the man that is meant to be interesting but the hidden details 
                    that are only hinted at in the original work. This could be supported by the chose to make Henryk a silent protagonist which 
                    makes him much more mysterious.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    In short Henryk being represented by The Son of Man is a metaphor representing that Henryk is a lot more important and interesting
