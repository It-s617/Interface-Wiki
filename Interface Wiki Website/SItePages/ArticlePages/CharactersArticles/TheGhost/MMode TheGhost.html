            <h2>Powers And Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                Henryks’s daughter likely has normal human abilities and may have some other powers inherited from Henryk however this is not 
                shown, unless her becoming a cerebral electricity monster is related to her being henry’s daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ghost has normal human abilities and seems to have limited shapeshifting powers, the ability to create multiple hands which 
                she can control, and the ability to flat and fly.

                This segment will be going over all the timeline of Henryk’s great-granddaughter in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.

            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>

                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i>

            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i>

        <p>
            After 1945: Henryk’s daughter is born, and Henryk becomes a father             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            During Episode 16 we see the tree being planted that is shown in the photo of their wedding. As his wife is not visibly pregnant 
            during the wedding and after the tree has grown, this implies that Henryk’s daughter was born before they were married.            
        </p> 

        <p>
            After 1953, 1: Henryk’s Wife died from an unknown illness            
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1953, 2: Henryk attendees his wife’s funeral with his 
            daughter and the paster who is hosting the funeral, is noticeably freak out by his apparent agelessness.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Henryks daughter mentions in episode 6 that her mom died when she was young but clearly remember details of 
            her funeral and other stories her mom shared with her implying, she was at lest 8 years old as this is the age 
            children usually develop their long-term memory.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Given that Henryk appeared young enough to be noticeable weird it is implied that this likely happened closer 
            to 1963 or 1973 as Henryk would only be 43 in 1953 so looking young would not be weird, however for the reasons
            I have stated above I think the earliest date would still be 1953.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            After 1963: Henryk’s Granddaughter or Grandson is born making him a Grandfather and making Henryk’s daughter a mother.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1963: The conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode Six about if Henryk can ever die takes place.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            After 1963: Henryk and his daughter also make perogies and the conversation between Henryk and his daughter seen in Episode 
            Sixteen about when Henryk fell from the sky happens.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification           
        </p> 
        <p>
            The earliest reasonable point for Henryk’s daughter to be born is 1945 after the end of World War 2. This means that the 
            earliest possible point for Henryk’s granddaughter to be born is 1963 as this would be 18 years after the earliest year 
            Henryk’s daughter is born, though it is likely latter.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Additional for the same reasons this is the earliest point for the conversations seen in episode 6 and 16 as Henryk’s 
            daughter is seen as an adult who is not noticeable old.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            Around 2012, 2: Henryk’s great-granddaughter is born making Henryk a great-grandfather and Henryk’s daughter a grandmother.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Around 2012, 3: Henryk’s family photo is taken by Henryk.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We know Henryks Great-Granddaughter was still a baby around 1 to 3 years old in 2015 as this is the date of the crash, given 
            that the series is believed to be set in 2017 then it would make her 3 years old at youngest and 5 years old at oldest. If 
            she is 5 years old this would also roughly match the appearance of Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Given that The Museum Boy appears the same age as Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter this can be used to approximate his age.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            We see the photo of Henryk’s family has both his daughter and great-granddaughter meaning that Henryk’s daughter must 
            die after Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter was born, given that Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter is still a bay during the 
            crash she this would be about at the similar time.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            2015, EP20, 1: Henryks’ daughter dies of old age and becomes The Ghost.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 2: After watching his daughter die Henryk attempts suicide by walking out into traffic. either Henryk’s 
            powers activate to protect him or the car swerves into the river, regardless.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 3: Mischief speaks to The Ghost and makes a deal with her.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 4: Henryk’s family die excluding his Great-Granddaughter who is taken by The Ghost.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 5: The cerebral electricity of Henryk’s dead family is consumed by Mischief.           
        </p> 

        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            These events are shown to happen in quick succession in Episode 20 of Interfaces, so they likely happen on the same day.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henryk’s 
            abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
            to when the home was abandoned.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            I believe that Henryk would have abandoned his home Immediately after his suicide attempted, as this place is likely painful 
            for him, hence him abandoning it.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            This also makes sense with Henryk’s daughter as she is shown as a baby in episode 20 and a young child 7 at most through 
            the series which is set in about 2017 making her likely 2-3 years old during the crash and 4-5 years old in the show.

           2017: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>The Ghosts Deal with Mischief</b>

            <p>
                The Ghost requests that Mischief brings Henryk back to how he used to be, presumably meaning when he was less depressed. She 
                also commands that Mischief informs Henryk of his grate-granddaughters survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                In exchange for this Mischief will receive all that perish, the meaning of this is not entirely clear but it seems more than 
                likely that this refers to the cerebral electricity in the interface, the interfaces is a form of digital afterlife that “all that 
                perish” will presumably go to. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This would also explain The Ghost’s actions in episode 4 as she shows no resistance to being absorbed to the Greetings Robotics 
                system. This appears odd in the series be could be explained by this being a part of their deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mischief mentions in Episode 24 that he was worried about the consequences of Henryk not waking up this may imply that there are
                established consequences of breaking the deal that are not made clear in the series. Additionally, it is possible that this would 
                only result in him not getting what The Ghost promised him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mischief likely could not have beaten The Mechanical Saccorhytus without being consumed by him and corrupting him, which is odd 
                considering that The Mechanical Saccorhytus seams to be made with the intent of being able to absorb large amounts of cerebral 
                electricity so Mischief should not be able to corrupt him. This leads me to believe that as part of their deal when Henryk and 
                his greet-granddaughter are reunited she will somehow disable whatever was protecting The Mechanical Saccorhytus to allow Mischief 
                to consume the Cerebral Electricity from The Interface.

            <b>Shiva Comparison</b>
            <p>
                The Ghost is compared to a Hindu goddess called shiva by Greetings Robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the origine of this is form the quote, “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed; a few people 
                cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade 
                the prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multiarmed form and says, ‘Now I am become Death, the 
                destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote is highly relevant to the series as it is about the change to the world after the creation of nuclear bombs, which 
                allegorically relates to interfaces which is about the changes to the world after the discovery of cerebral electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
                From what I have read Shiva is a different form of Vishnu and another god called Rudra. Noticeably all these gods are portrayed as 
                having multiple arms which relates to The Ghost as she has many hands.
            </p>
            <br>

            <i>
                Name speculation 
            </i>
            <p>
                Christina or Christa 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ghost is compared to a painting named Christina’s World and her voices acter is called Christa, this is likely a coincidence 
                but may imply that The Ghosts real name is some verity of Christina.
