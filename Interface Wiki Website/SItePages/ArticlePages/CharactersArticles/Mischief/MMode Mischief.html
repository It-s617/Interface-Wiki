            <h2>Description</h2>
     
            <b>Physical Appearance</b>
            <p>
                Before his transformation Proto-Mischief looked mostly like a normal human with most of his features covered by clown makeup and 
                his clown attire.
            </p>   
            <p>
                After his transformation Mischief usually appears as a bright pink worm like creature with yellow horn-like things on his 
                forehead, a big smile with yellow teeth and a clown nose.
            </p>  
            <p>
               Mischief is commonly shown to shapeshift meaning he can look like anything, usually he limits himself to being pink, but he has 
               been confirmed to be able to change colours in Episode 11 Revelations and Episode 5 The Son of Man.  
            </p> 
            <br>

            <b>Personality </b>
            <p>
               Mischief is very outgoing and friendly, but he is not above being deceptive. Mischief can be somewhat self-interested and can struggle to control 
               his impulses but is not shown to be actively malicious.

            <p>
                Mischief is able to shapeshift including the ability to change colours, fly and float, and absorb cerebral electricity which 
                seemingly gives him knowledge on what he has absorbed, it is not clear if he also gets there powers like KAMI.

                This segment will be going over all the events of Mischife's life in order. I will do this as extensively

            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.

        <p>
            Before 1893 Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl is born.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We know that Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl was working for dreamland in 1911 and appeared to be 
            an adult so that means he was likely born at least 18 years before 1911.            
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            Between 1904-1911: Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl joined the Foolish house in dreamland.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We know that Proto-Mischief, The Ringmaster, and The Foolish Girl was working for Dreamland when it burned down meaning 
            he must have been working there before hand, as he is the head on the building it is likely he has there from the 
            beginning, meaning 1904.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            1911, 1: Proto-Mischief and The Foolish Girl take a bow on the stage of The Foolish House.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1911, 2: The Ringmaster stands of stage of Proto-Mischief retires and looks upset.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            1911, 3: Proto-Mischief leaves the entertainment industry.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            1911, 4: the same day Proto-Mischief retires dreamland burns down.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1911, 5: The Ringmaster and The Foolish Girl likely leaves the entertainment industry after Dreamland burns down.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            At one point in Episode 21 Mischief says "The year was 1911. Two comedians take a bow, 54 years too soon." This 
            references the painting the two comedians.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            This all implies that Proto-Mischief retired from dreamland and did not leave because of the fire. However, we 
            also see Proto-Mischief watching the fire well dressed in his comedian outfit, implying that he retires the day of the fire.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            The Ringmaster appears noticeably upset during the scene he is shown in Episode 21 this may imply that he and Proto-Mischief 
            had been having problems and one of them may have purposely or accidently set fire to dreamland. This is contradicted by 
            reality where the fire was an accident.

            1943, 1: The Philadelphia Experiment accusers teleporting the USS Eldridge to New York from Philadelphia.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 2: Proto-Mischief is turned into pure cerebral electricity before floating into the sky and being shot to death by 
            the military.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 3: Proto-Mischief falls to the earth and fully transforms into a cerebral electricity monster. As Proto-Mischief 
            transforms into Mischief the screen shows pictures of KAMI to compare the two.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            1943, 4: Mischief says boo to Mr Greeting before leaving.             
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            The events of The Philadelphia Experiment is repeatedly mentioned to have taken places in 1943.            
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            2015, EP20, 1: Mischief slivers through the woods.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 2: Mischief speaks to The Ghost and makes a deal with her.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            2015, EP20, 3: The cerebral electricity of Henryk’s dead family is consumed by Mischief.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            These events are shown to happen in quick succession in Episode 20 of Interfaces, so they likely happen on the same day.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henryk’s 
            abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
            to when the home was abandoned.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            I believe that Henryk would have abandoned his home Immediately after his suicide attempted, as this place is likely painful 
            for him, hence him abandoning it.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            This also makes sense with Henryk’s daughter as she is shown as a baby in episode 20 and a young child 7 at most through 
            the series which is set in about 2017 making her likely 2-3 years old during the crash and 4-5 years old in the show.

            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            The events of this episode are much more surrealist than normal, yet this episode is set in 1911 at the latest which is 
            well before The Philadelphia experiment. This is easily explained by this being a dream of Mischief past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the dream would take places in the timeline is less clear but it’s likely some point in 2017 and I’m putting it 
            here as this is in line with the episode order. A more likely point for this to take places is during episode 19 well 
            Henryk sleeps, though it is not confirmed if Mischief sleep at that point or not.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>The Ghosts Deal with Mischief </b>
            <p>
                The Ghost requests that Mischief brings Henryk back to how he used to be, presumably meaning when he was less depressed. She also 
                commands that Mischief informs Henryk of his grate-granddaughters survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                In exchange for this Mischief will receive all that perish, the meaning of this is not entirely clear but it seems more than 
                likely that this refers to the cerebral electricity in the interface, the interfaces is a form of digital afterlife that “all that 
                perish” will presumably go to. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This would also explain The Ghost’s actions in episode 4 as she shows no resistance to being absorbed to the Greetings Robotics 
                system. This appears odd in the series be could be explained by this being a part of their deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mischief mentions in Episode 24 that he was worried about the consequences of Henryk not waking up this may imply that there are 
                established consequences of breaking the deal that are not made clear in the series. Additionally, it is possible that this would 
                only result in him not getting what The Ghost promised him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mischief likely could not have beaten The Mechanical Saccorhytus without being consumed by him and corrupting him, which is odd 
                considering that The Mechanical Saccorhytus seams to be made with the intent of being able to absorb large amounts of cerebral 
                electricity so Mischief should not be able to corrupt him. This leads me to believe that as part of their deal when Henryk and 
                his greet-granddaughter are reunited she will somehow disable whatever was protecting The Mechanical Saccorhytus to allow Mischief 
                to consume the Cerebral Electricity from The Interface.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <b>Was Mischief Lying to Henryk </b>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
               When the details of Mischief deal with The Ghost where reviled it appears that he was lying to Henryk. However, I do not agree with
               this I will explain why bellow.

            </p>
            <p>
               The main reasons people think he is lying are his actions before Episode 11, he doesn’t tell Henryk about the deal with The Ghost 
               and makes it seem like he has just interested in Henryk, during Episode 5 he makes it seem like he doesn’t know what Henryk wants 
               when he should know the sources of Henryk trauma. This makes it seem like Mischief is trying to lie to Henryk.
 
            </p>
            <p>
               However, Mischief never lies about knowing where Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter, Henryk never asks, and Mischief tells him as soon as 
               he feels that he understands Henryk. Additional in episode 8 we see that Mischief was unaware of Henryk’s age and it seams like he 
               has generally pore knowledge on Henryk beyond what happened during the crash that killed most of Henryk’s family.
 
            </p>
            <p>
               To me this makes it seem a lot more like Mischief was trying to learn more about Henryk and what drives him before reviling his 
               greet granddaughter survived. This makes sense considering that one of the key terms of Mischifes deal with The Ghost seams to be 
               that he will make Henryk happy again, so it would be important to get to know him before dropping a massive piece of information 
               like that, which may have been destressing to Henryk.

            </p>
            <p>
               So in short well Mischief was clearly being dishonest I don’t think it is fair to say that he was lying or being malicious before 
               episode 11. 
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <b>Mischief and Sunflowers</b>

            <p>
                Sunflowers are commonly associated with Mischief so I will go over the analyses of their use in each episode bellow.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>Sunflowers in Episode 5 The Son of Man </b>
            <p>
                When The Museum Boy enters the room with the son of man painting in it Mischief hides as a sunflower and ends up searching 
                The Museum Boy.
            </p>
            <p>
               If we are going on the interpretation of sunflowers being a reputation of death then this would show likely with most people the 
               museum oy is scared of death.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>Sunflowers in Episode 14 Dreamland </b>
            <br>
            <i>Sunflowers Are Mischief, Mischief Is a Dragon, And Dragons Are Death </i>
            <p>
               This episode has what I believe to be a three-layered metaphor about Death, Dragons, Mischief, And Sunflowers I will attempt to 
               explain here.
            </p>
            <br>

            <i>Layer one, death is a dragon</i>
            <p>
                When The Ringmaster is giving the fine part of his monolog he clearly corelates the dragon with death, The Ringmaster claims that 
                he saw death in his dream but then the story’s about a dragon and if you listening to the monologue its very clear that the dragon 
                is meant to be a metaphor for death. At an earlier point in the monologue The Ringmaster claims that people may have seen death at 
                the bottom of a bottle, this is another example of a similar metaphor to help prove my point.
            </p>

            <i>Layer two, Mischief is a dragon </i>
            <p>
                Mischief being a dragon is easier to explain and prove, in the end of the episode we see The Ringmaster introduces the dragon he 
                apparently tamed before Proto-Mischief is shown. I believe that only would prove the connection but there is more proof at one 
                point in the monologue The Ringmaster says “That’s when I saw it! It twisted and twirled towards me. I saw Its wicked smile, I 
                heard its wicked laugh!” this is clearly talking about Mischief as he is known to travel in a similar manner and is known to have 
                a sinister smile.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I believe that Mischief as a dragon still represents death, the part of the monologue that most directly talks about 
                death is as the part that most directly talks about death, the line of the monolog being the line about the dragon twisting and 
                twirling. The way The Ringmaster talks about the dragon makes it seem like his talking about death as a separate entity to the 
                dragon, but the sentence would only really makes sense if he is talking about both. It is important to remember that The 
                Ringmaster is also clearly talking about Mischief, so it only makes sense that Mischief represents both the dragon and death.
 
            </p>
            <br>

            <i>Layer three, Mischief is a sunflower </i>
            <p>
                Before getting into this episode, I feel it is important to remind you of when Mischief transformed into a sunflower in episode 
                five and says, “I’m a beautiful sunflower”, it doesn’t really get clearer than that but there is more proof of the metaphor in 
                episode fourteen.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the episode we see a scene where the shot is constantly changing between Proto-Mischief and a sunflower that may imply that the 
               two are being corelated. We also see another scene where we see Proto-Mischief walking down a corridor with his reflection being 
               replaced by a sunflower. Well ever of these two examples could mean nothing on their own it, but taking both metaphors together 
               with the scene from episode five it is a much clearer corelation between sunflowers and Mischief. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This leaves the question of if sunflowers are also meant to corelate to dragons and death my answer yes-ish.
            </p>
            <p>
               I believe the dragon analogy purely apples to Mischief in this one scene. Mischief  clearly isn’t a dragon, I think the dragon is 
               just a metaphor for death used in the monologue as a way to avoid directly calling Mischief  death, in simple terms I believe that 
               if Mischief  is not a dragon, is death and Sunflowers are Mischief  then sunflowers must represent death and Mischief  but not 
               dragons.
            </p>
            <br><br>


            <b>Episode 21 Revelations</b>
            <p>
                We see The Museum Boy growing a sunflower before seeing it fall out The Window well, he is watching the interview with Mr Greetings. I believe that the metaphor’s specified in dreamland apply here and gives the scene a deeper meaning, which I will explained here.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The metaphor in Episode 14 Dreamland was that Mischief represents death and sunflowers represent both Mischief and death. Mischief has also been shown to represent the future and the next generation as shown in “bear wittiness” where he is compered to The New Man, who is literally the generation following the year 1943.
 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first scene shows The Museum Boy being interested in growing the sunflower, I believe that this is meant to show that the boy is interested in the future and the progress of the world as said above this is what Mischief represents and sunflowers are represents Mischief.
  
            </p>
            <p>
                The second scene shows The Museum Boy watching the Mr Greetings interview as the sunflower falls out of The Window. I believe that this is meant to show that the boy losses interest in the future because of what Mr Greetings is saying in the interview, this is lily what Mr Greetings intends due to his sole goal being to take the world back to the way it was before 1943.
 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I believe that this scene could also be about death, in dreamland this is implied to be something that Mischief represents. So, the scene where he grows the sunflower would represent him expecting death in his life and the scene where the sunflower falls would represent him rejecting death. This makes some sense as The Interface is shown to be a form of digital afterlife meaning that Mr Greetings has essentially ended death in the world.

                The character snooze button appears to be a flower of some kind and may be a sunflower if this is the case I assume that snooze

            <i>Approximate age </i>
            <p>
                We know that Proto-Mischief was working for dreamland in 1911 and appeared to be an adult so that means he was likely born at 
                least 18 years before 1911. Making him 106 years old at the time of the interface series.

                Approximate Age Justification

            <p>
                Mischief Earliest known point in The Timeline is 1911 as he was at Dreamland when it burned down. assuming he was born during the fire that would make him exactly 106, however this is absurd as at this point, he was human and appears as an adult.

            </p>
            <p>
                From his appearance he was in his twenties or thirty’s making him around 126 to 136 years old, but I would say more than 106 as this is the most accurate.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                All this is assuming that the series takes places in 2017, which is the release date of Episode One.

            <i>Gender Presentation (C.E.M) Means</i>
            <p>
                Cerebral Electricity Monsters are shown to be essential entirely unique species for each different character, entirely defined by 
                their perspective and memories of the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This could be interpreted as them being entirely unique creatures in every way which may involve gender or sex, however the 
                details of their transformation are not made clear in the series so I went with how they largely appear in the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said Mischief seams to identify as a male, when we see him in 1911 that he has male when he was still human and 
                there’s no evidence presented in the series that would imply that this has changed. Noticeable, all characters that refer 
                directly to Mischief with pronounces use he, him, though that’s basically just Mr Greetings in episode 24.
