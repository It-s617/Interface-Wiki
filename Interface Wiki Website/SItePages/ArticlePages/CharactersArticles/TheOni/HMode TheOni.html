            <h2>Description</h2>
     
            <b>Physical Appearance</b>
            <p>
                The Oni strongly resembles an adult human wearing an Oni mask.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Oni masks are originally from Japan and are made to resemble creatures that are usually described as monsters or demons.

            </p>  
            <p>
                The Oni may be red in coloration as this is what they appear as in The Condemnation however this could just be a result of the 
                lighting of the scene.
            </p> 
            <br><br>

            <b>Personality </b>
            <p>
                The Oni has no observable personality as of yet.

            </p>   
            <p>
                It is possible that their personality will be an invers of KAMI’s as there appearance is strongly reminiscent of a Japanese Oni, 
                Oni’s represent demons in Japan while KAMI usually translates to god which would imply they are opposites.
            </p>  
            <br><br>

            <b>Note</b>
            <p>
                All information in this article acts under the assumption that this is a variation of KAMI that was created as a result of her 
                self-destruction in episode 24. If this is proven false, basically everything here will be false.

            <p>
                The Oni’s abilities are largely unknown as we have seen very little of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible that they will have inherited KAMI’s powers, which would include The Chefs and The Ghosts powers.

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the events of Henryk’s family in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>

           2017, 1: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            2017, 3: The Oni is seen crawling through an abandoned farm. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Justification
        </p>        
        <p>
            Assuming The Oni is a post transformation KAMI it makes the most sense for this scene to take places slightly after the events of the series.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>Who is The Oni</b>
            <p>
                The Oni appears to have a connection to KAMI, I believe that The Oni is  meant to be a transformed version of KAMI after her self 
                destruction ion episode 24 The abyss.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Oni is an incredibly unique creature even within the interface’s universe. As form what we can tell The Oni is the result of 
                KAMI transforming into a Cerebral Electricity Monster, KAMI being a robot containing a large amount of cerebral electricity 
                presumably from humans.
            </p>
            <p>
               Given that cerebral electricity monsters seem to have forms heavily based on their memory’s and perspectives on the world this 
               would likely lead to The Oni being incurably unique as they are a composite of many people cerebral electricity that was being 
               contained by KAMI.

            <i>Gender Presentation: Unclear (C.E.M)</i>
            <p>
                The Oni’s unique origins make it very hard to tell what there gender would be as well as their appearance not paratactically 
                leaning male or female. Thay are not currently shown to have enough of a personality that would tell us what their gender may be.                
            </p>

            <i>Approximate Age: Unclear</i>
            <p>
                KAMI was seemingly unveiled in 2017 so this may imply that The Oni is one years old, as the year is not shown to change during the 
                interfaces series which takes places in 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
                If The Oni and KAMI are to be considered different characters, then their age would reset at the end of the interfaces series. 
                This would still leave there age as unclear as it is not clear when The Condemnation takes places.
