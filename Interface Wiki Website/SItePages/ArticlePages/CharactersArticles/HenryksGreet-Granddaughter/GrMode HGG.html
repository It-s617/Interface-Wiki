            <p>
                Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter appears as a young girl with long brown hair.

            <b>Personality </b>
            <p>
                Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter personality is not clear in the series as she has no lines and few appearances in the series. 
                The only thing that is clear about this character is that she seems to love her grandmother, The Ghost as she is upset when 
                she is taken and seams happier when they have been reunited in episode 21.

            <p>
                Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter is seemingly a normal child and likely has the ability of a regular person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Henryk’s Greet-Granddaughter may be more powerful than she first appears as she is a direct descendant of Henryk. she may have 
                inhered some of his powers or may have a grater chances of becoming a cerebral electricity monster when she dies like The Ghost 
                did.

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the timeline of Henryk’s great-granddaughter in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.

                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>

                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i>

                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i>

            Around 2012, 2: Henryk’s great-granddaughter is born making Henryk a great-grandfather and Henryk’s daughter a grandmother.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Around 2012, 3: Henryk’s family photo is taken by Henryk.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We know Henryks Great-Granddaughter was still a baby around 1 to 3 years old in 2015 as this is the date of the crash, given 
            that the series is believed to be set in 2017 then it would make her 3 years old at youngest and 5 years old at oldest. If 
            she is 5 years old this would also roughly match the appearance of Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter.            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Given that The Museum Boy appears the same age as Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter this can be used to approximate his age.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            We see the photo of Henryk’s family has both his daughter and great-granddaughter meaning that Henryk’s daughter must 
            die after Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter was born, given that Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter is still a bay during the 
            crash she this would be about at the similar time.           
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
            2015, EP20, 5: Henryk’s family die excluding his Great-Granddaughter who is taken by The Ghost.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            My reasoning for these events happening in 2015 is the calendar we see in episode 16 where we see a calendar in Henryk’s 
            abandoned house dated November 2015 it is odd for the scene to focus on this for no reason, so I think it has given a hint
            to when the home was abandoned.           
        </p>

           2017, 1: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>Is She a Willing Hostage</b>
            <p>
                In Episode 21 she is shown to be much happier as her old apartment building is restored, she then walks away and is seemingly 
                greeted by The Ghost, this seemingly implies she was tricked by Greetings Robotics into thinking that The Ghost was willingly 
                working with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                However in episode 24 she is clearly uncomfortable and runs away as soon as possible so she has likely figured out that this was 
                only a copy of The Ghost being used by Greetings Robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I am right about her having been tricked, she would not be a willing hostage but would have likely gone with them willingly at 
                first.
