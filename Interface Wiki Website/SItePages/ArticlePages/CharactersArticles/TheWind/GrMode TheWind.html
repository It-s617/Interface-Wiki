            <p>
                The Wind seems to have some form of limited-omniscience as they seem to be able to see the past and future but they also talk 
                about searching for something meaning they likely can’t see everything, The Wind also has the ability to float and freeze time.

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the timeline of The Wind in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>

        <p>
        Before 1925: Proto-Wind is born.    
        </p> 
        <p>       
        Justification
        </p> 
        <p>
        Proto-Wind must have been born at least 18 years before joining the military so the earliest possible date for him being born is 1925, it is possible he was born before this.

        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
        Before 1943: Proto-Wind joins the military more specifically the navy.
        </p> 
        <p>       
        Justification
        </p> 
        <p>
        We know that Proto-Wind was in the military during 1945 as this is the date of The Philadelphia Experiment so he must have been in the 
        military before that. 
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
        1943: The Philadelphia Experiment accusers teleporting the USS Eldridge to New York from Philadelphia.
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
        Before 2017: The Wind is scanned by Greetings Robotics, or they somehow partially capture him.  
        </p> 
        <p>       
        Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
        We see in the scenes of KAMI’s programming from episode 18, that she has data from The Wind but has not captured him. this is never 
        greatly elaborated upon so this would be my best gusset.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>Comparison to Ga-Oh</b>
            <p>
                The Wind is compered to Ga-Oh a wind god from Iroquois mythology by greetings robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ga-oh is a wind god from Iroquois mythology, this is likely meant to contrasty to The Wind who observes has a strong correlation 
                with wind.
            </p>
            <p>
                From what I have read it seems that Ga-Oh is a mostly benevolent spirit but can become restless and dangerous which seems to 
                correlate well with The Winds. Ga-Oh is also related to the cardinal directions which relates to The Wind as he talks about 
                these in his visions.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>The Wind’s Vision </b>

            <p>
                In this segment I will be analysis The Winds monologue from Episode 15 The Winds and explain what I believe it means.
                                
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that the directions correlate to time in this monologue with north representing the present and futter, east representing 
                the future, south representing the past and present, and lastly west represent the past. Most of the following Analysis still 
                works regardless of this being true but this dose helps the theory.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                For north he says “In this land of rot and erosion” as Henryk’s faces is shown. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                This may refer to all of Canada or moder times in general regardless of it implies the current world and land is in a state of 
                decay.
               
            </p>
            <p>
                for east he says “You stand alone for” the scene showing dragonflies resembling Henryk and Mischief. 
                
            </p>            
            <p>
                This could be implied to refer to Henryk in the future, saying he will be alone. This makes some sense as in episode 24 Mischief 
                is believed to sacrifice himself to Henryk however Henryk still has his granddaughter so he cannot be said to be truly alone.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                for south he says “static, stoic, frozen” showing a scene with Henryk by a plane with two men in military uniforms, then a 
                picture with Henryk and his with and as final image of them holding hands before the female hand disappears leaving only the ring. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                This is clearly referring to Henryk’s incorrigibility and how the world has moved around him. We see images from Henryk’s past 
                moving forward which falls in line with this line being about Henryk’s incurability and the direction correlating to time.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                for west he says “I scan the horizon... not heavens skies nor cavers below… I see your home a stat of abandon there is no judgment 
                only dangers aglow the shot changes to focuses on Henryk for most of this scene.
               
            </p>
            <p>
                This Is the segment I am the least clear on but if the direction correlating to time theory is accurate then this segment would 
                seemingly be referring to the destruction of Henryk’s family. This is further supported by Henryk’s daughter comments on Henryk’s 
                immortality being played during this scene.
                
            </p>  
            <p>
                All together I believe that this monologue is talking about the Henryk’s shame in the death of his family, well enviably everybody 
                in Henryk’s family would die, we see in episode twenty that Henryk has directly responsible for the death of two members of his 
                family and the loss of Henryk’s Great-Granddaughter.

            <p>
               Cerebral Electricity Monsters are shown to be essential entirely unique species for each different character, entirely defined by 
               their perspective and memories of the world. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
               This could be interpreted as them being entirely unique creatures in every way which may involve gender or sex, however the details 
               of there transformation are not made clear in the series so I went with how they largely appear in the series.

            <p>
               The Wind’s age is not made clear as he only appears after The Philadelphia Experiment, and we never see him before his 
               transformation if we assume that he transformed during The Philadelphia Experiment then he must be at least 92 years old.

               The Wind is presumably alive but as Greetings Robotics seems to have at least scanned him that makes his fate more nebules.
