            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the events of Henryk’s family in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>
            </p>

           2017: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>Sunflowers</b>
            <p>
                Sunflowers are commonly associated with The Museum Boy most notably in episode 5 and episode 21, I will go over both bellow.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>
                Episode 5 The Son of Man
            </b>
            <p>
                When The Museum Boy enters the room with the son of man painting in it Mischief hides as a sunflower and ends up searching The 
                Museum Boy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we are going on the interpretation of sunflowers being a reputation of death then this would show likely with most people the 
                museum oy is scared of death.  
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>
                Episode 21 Revelation
            </b>
            <p>
                We see The Museum Boy growing a sunflower before seeing it fall out The Window well, he is watching the interview with Mr Greetings. I believe that the metaphor’s specified in dreamland apply here and gives the scene a deeper meaning, which I will explained here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The metaphor in Episode 14 Dreamland was that Mischief represents death and sunflowers represent both Mischief and death. Mischief has also been shown to represent the future and the next generation as shown in “bear wittiness” where he is compered to The New Man, who is literally the generation following the year 1943.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first scene shows The Museum Boy being interested in growing the sunflower, I believe that this is meant to show that the boy is interested in the future and the progress of the world as said above this is what Mischief represents and sunflowers are represents Mischief.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second scene shows The Museum Boy watching the Mr Greetings interview as the sunflower falls out of The Window. I believe that this is meant to show that the boy losses interest in the future because of what Mr Greetings is saying in the interview, this is lily what Mr Greetings intends due to his sole goal being to take the world back to the way it was before 1943.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I believe that this scene could also be about death, in dreamland this is implied to be something that Mischief represents. So, the scene where he grows the sunflower would represent him expecting death in his life and the scene where the sunflower falls would represent him rejecting death. This makes some sense as The Interface is shown to be a form of digital afterlife meaning that Mr Greetings has essentially ended death in the world.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The Oni appears to have a connection to KAMI, I believe that The Oni is  meant to be a transformed version of KAMI after her self 
                destruction ion episode 24 The abyss.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Oni is an incredibly unique creature even within the interface’s universe. As form what we can tell The Oni is the result of 
                KAMI transforming into a Cerebral Electricity Monster, KAMI being a robot containing a large amount of cerebral electricity 
                presumably from humans.
            </p>
            <p>
               Given that cerebral electricity monsters seem to have forms heavily based on their memory’s and perspectives on the world this 
               would likely lead to The Oni being incurably unique as they are a composite of many people cerebral electricity that was being 
               contained by KAMI.
