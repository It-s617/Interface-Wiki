            <b>Physical Appearance</b>
            <p>
                The Mechanical Saccorhytus is usually a large blimp with a face at the front of it. However, The Mechanical Saccorhytus can 
                transform into another form that heavily resembles a large baby.

            <b>Personality </b>

                The Mechanical Saccorhytus is usually inanimate but after transforming into a big baby we take on the usually personality of 
                a baby being very hungry and emotional.

            <h2>Powers And Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                In his normal form The Mechanical Saccorhytus will be able to do anything a blimp can do and can seemingly absorb and store cerebral electricity.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                In his baby form he seems much more capable of absorbing cerebral electricity and seems massively strong even being able to pick up a lighthouse, he doesn’t portray any special abilities beyond that however.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mechanical Saccorhytus may be able to uses the abilities of the cerebral electricity monsters like KAMI as in episode 12 and 18 it looks like he uses The Ghost powers, but it could just be KAMI doing this of screen.

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the timeline of The Mechanical Saccorhytus in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.

            <br>
            <p>

            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i>

            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.

            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>

                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>

            After 1945, 2: The Mechanical Saccorhytus is bult by Greetings Robotics presumably ordered by Mr Greetings.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification            
        </p> 
        <p>
            We do not get much information on when Greetings Robotics was founded but it can be assumed that this was shortly after 
            World War 2 as Mr Greeting is a very well-known and established person in The Interfaces world which would imply that he 
            has been actively working for quite some time.           
        </p> 
        <p>
            It is easy to assume that The Mechanical Saccorhytus was more likely bult during the 2000s but we do not get any information
            on when it was bult or unveiled so all I can say for sure is that it was bult after World War 2. Additionally, it is possible
            that the blimp was originally made earlier, and latter modified into The Mechanical Saccorhytus.

            <h2>Analysis </h2>

            <b>Why Have KAMI When The Mechanical Saccorhytus Is So Much Stronger </b>
            <p>
                During her fight with The Chef, we see that The Chef was capable of beating KAMI before The Mechanical Saccorhytus using 
                The Ghosts powers appears behind him capturing him. We also see that after KAMI self-destruction The Mechanical Saccorhytus 
                is sent in to capture Mischief, this leads to the question why Greetings Robotics needed KAMI.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think this is simply because KAMI is easier to control and can be relied upon while The Mechanical Saccorhytus is unreliable.
                When The Mechanical Saccorhytus is in his baby form he is massively emotionally and seams easily distracted likely meaning 
                that he is not reliable for capturing other Cerebral electricity monsters.

               The Mechanical Saccorhytus appears to be a robotic blimp animated by cerebral electricity, meaning whatever conscience they have is 
               likely a composite of the memories contained in the cerebral electricity which would likely lead it to having a difficult time 
               understanding itself enough similar to a baby. Thia is why I don’t think they have a meaningful gender at all.

                It is entirely unclear when The Mechanical Saccorhytus was made, as there is no information given on this over than we know it 
                would have to be after The Philadelphia Experiment during 1943, it is likely that he was bult shortly before The Interface series 
                in 2017, similar to KAMI.

                After Mischief is consumed by The Mechanical Saccorhytus it slows down and then collapses, appearing dead but this is never 
                confirmed in the series. During safe mode we see that Mischief had forced the Interfaces and presumably The Mechanical 
                Saccorhytus into its safe mode which could explain why it collapses, making it unclear if they are dead at the ends of the series.

                The Mechanical Saccorhytus doesn’t appear to be a cerebral electricity monster as it has not transformed from a human and still 
                seams animated by pure cerebral electricity. The Mechanical Saccorhytus appears to just be a blimp that is being powered and 
                animated by cerebral electricity, I have decide to call devices like this “Cerebral Electricity Container”, but I will put 
                unclear as nothing is confirmed in the series.

                Umami has confessed that the scene where The Mechanical Saccorhytus drinks the cerebral electricity of the lighthouse was not originally planned.
