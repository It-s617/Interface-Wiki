            <b>Physical Appearance</b>
            <p>
                KAMI is a white and black robot with wires coming out the back of her head that resembles dreadlocks, her chest is covered by what 
                appears to be a ribcage with cerebral electricity behind it, at the centre of her ribcage is a small heart. On her back there is a 
                Japanese’s symbol that means God or KAMI in Japanese’s.
            </p>   
            <p>
                KAMI’s mask has to bright red circles on her checks, bright red lips and to holes for her to see through. 
            </p>  
            <br><br>

            <b>Personality </b>
            <p>
                KAMI is a robot that contains cerebral electricity if she has a personality, she doesn’t show it externally, beyond occasionally 
                staring at her mask.

            <h2>Powers And Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                KAMI has the ability to absorb the cerebral electricity of others, this granted her the memories and abilities of anybody she absorbs.

            </p>
            <p>
               Her original powers where seemingly flying, telekinesis and the ability to destroy and rebuild physical objects. She is also likely capable of anything a regular human can do but we only see her fighting. 
 
            </p>
            <p>
               KAMI absorbed The Ghost which seemingly expanded her transformation ability and lets her use her meany armed form, this also gave her the ability to summon and use The Ghost’s hands.
 
            </p>
            <p>
               KAMI absorbed The Chef gained his powers this allowed her to change colours and fully shapeshift, according to her code she also got “INTUITION” from him, it is not clear what this means but it likely refers to the visons The Chef has so this likely gives her a limited form of precognition 
 
            </p>
            <p>
               KAMI may have received some powers form The Wind as her code seemingly references him but it also claims that “TRANCES ELEMENTS ONLY” only so I don’t think she has significant abilities from this.
 
            </p>

        <div id="AS4" class="EAPI5" >
        
            <h2>Personal Timeline </h2>

            <p>
                This segment will be going over all the events of KAMI’s Life in order. I will do this as extensively 
                as possible so some speculation will be included but this will be shown as speculation to the best of my ability.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Below is an explanation for how the timeline works.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                All events will be in chronological order if possible. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                If multiple events happen in the same year that will be numbered in the order they occur, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Events that happen <b>within an episode</b> not a flashback will have the <i><b>episode number after the year.</b></i>
            </p>  
            <p>
                if the <b>order is unclear or there are no other events</b> then there will be <i><b>no number</b></i> to signify what the order they occurred in.
            </p>  
            <p>
                in cases where <b>only the order of some events are clear,</b> the events that have no clear order will <i><b>share a number.</b></i> 
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The date is as specific as it is written, explanations below for clarity.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is stated with <b>no additional information</b> that is the <i><b>exact year</b></i> it happened.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>before</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point before.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>after</b> a year it is that year or <i><b>any point after.</b></i> 
            </p>  
            <p>
                If a year is said to be <b>around</b> a year it is near that year but may be a few years <i><b>before or after.</b></i>
            </p>

        <p>
           2017, 1: The start of the Interface series.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            Justification 
        </p> 
        <p>
            9 Dec 2017 is the release data of the first episode. Given that the series is shown to be set in the modern day, roughly during 
            fall or summer then it makes sense that the series would take places in middle to late 2017.
        </p> 
        <p>
            A statue appears in the series called The Eye which was realised in 2011 meaning the series must take places after this.                    
        </p> 
        <p>
            In Episode 16 we see a calendar with a date on it of November 2015 which implies the series takes places a few years after this.      
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some of the other apparent dates in the series like how old Mr Greetings or Henryk’s great granddaughter appear in the series.       
        </p> 
        <br>

        <p>
           2017, EP3, 1: KAMI MRK 1 is constructed by Greetings Robotics.

            2017, EP12, 4: KAMI floats down from The Mechanical Saccorhytus and attacks The Chef taking on her meany armed 
            form and using The Ghost to protect herself.
        </p>
        <p>
            2017, EP12, 5: KAMI is pinned to the Mount Royal Cross and ever destroyed or critically damaged by The Chef.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            2017, EP18, 1: KAMI is seen aboard The Mechanical Saccorhytus and is being repaired and upgraded as well as having absorbed 
            The Chef 
        </p>
        <p>
            2017, EP18, 2: KAMI is seen to view the memories of The Chef and learn about Henryk’s and Mischief.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            2017, EP23, 4: KAMI is seen in the simulation of New York inside The Twin Towers as a plane collides with them.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            2017, EP24, 9: Mischief interfaces with KAMI and corrupts her triggering a self-destruct.	
        </p>
        <p>
            2017, EP24, 11: After KAMI dies, she persuasible transforms into The Oni.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            2017, 2: The end of the Interface series.
        </p>
        <br>
            
        <p>
            2017, 3: The Oni is seen crawling through an abandoned farm. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Justification
        </p>        
        <p>
            Assuming The Oni is a post transformation KAMI it makes the most sense for this scene to take places slightly after the events of the series.

                                This likely means that KAMI is searching the area for The Chef.

                                    The poem is also commonly used by sobriety groups as a call for privacy and the protection of anonymity. This likely 
                                    doesn’t correlate but given that KAMI is made of other people’s memories there a chance this is meant to represent 
                                    their memories being destroyed, this is not likely but possible.

            <b>KAMI Represents The Loss Of Individuality To Society </b>
            <br><br>
                    
            <p>
                Individuality is something that seems particularly important to the series, Mischief is arguably meant to represent 
                individualisation, noticeably in episode 22 quoting The Red Book which is all about individuality.
            </p>
            <p>
                KAMI how is directly antithetical to Mischief seems to be some form of robot that is powered by the collected Cerebral Electricity 
                of the dead. I think this may be meant to represent the loss of individuality that society often tries to enforce, practically by 
                people who are like Mr Greetings and are obsessed with an idea of how the world is meant to be.

            <b>Unclear Personal Details</b>
            <br><br>

            <i>Gender Presentation: Unclear (C.E.C)</i>
            <p>
                I have put unclear as KAMI is a robot and seemingly dose not have individuality which would likely mean that she doesn’t have a 
                gender. KAMI has a noticeably female appearance so I usually refer to her in female pronounces. This would work regardless as 
                objects similar to KAMI use female pronounces like you would do for a ship.              
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <i>Approximate Age: Unclear</i>
            <p>
                KAMI is seemingly unveiled at the start of the series in episode 3 this would make her age measured in days to months, unless the 
                unveiling is at an unknown point before the start of the series.
            </p>
            <p>
               Regardless of when she is unveiled, I do not feel that we have enough information to give her a definitive age.
            </p>
    
            <br><br>
            <i>Status: Unclear (presumed Transformed)</i>
            <p>
                We see after The Chef nearly destroyed KAMI that she is capable of being rebuilt so its possible that whatever is left of 
                greetings robotics can rebuild her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, it seems like The Oni is directly related to KAMI but its not clear how. I feel that it is most likely that she 
                transformed into The Oni after her self-destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could also be that this is from before KAMI was bult and this is a cerebral electricity monster that was used as a base for 
                KAMI, if this was the case whoever I would expect to see their code in KAMI’s programming which we do not. 
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <i>Species: Unclear (presumed Cerebral Electricity Container)</i>
            <p>
                KAMI doesn’t appear to be a cerebral electricity monster as she has not transformed from a human and still seams animated by pure
                cerebral electricity. KAMI appears to just be a robot that is being powered and animated by cerebral electricity, I have decide to 
                call devices like this “Cerebral Electricity Container”, but I will put unclear as nothing is confirmed in the series.
