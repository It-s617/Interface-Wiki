            <h2>Original Meaning of The Work</h2>
            <P>
                The original meaning of this work is meant to show the treachery of images, this is the most common theme in René’s paintings. 
                The treachery of images is an idea that describes how images deceive the viewer into believing that they are seeing the real 
                thing, but the paintings only actually depict a version of their subject often if not always inaccurately.
            </P>
            <P>
                One interpretation of this painting that I fell is highly relevant to the show is that this painting represents the viewers 
                desires to see the hidden meanings in artworks as depicted by the apple. If the figures faces were not obscured, we would have 
                no interest in his face but because it is obscured, we desire to learn more about it.
            </P>
            <P>
                This is a quote from RM talking about the painting “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden 
                by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the 
                form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is 
                present.”

                General Use in The Show
            </b>
            <p>
                This painting is very commonly referenced in the show, most commonly the man or apples are referenced which I will discuss below.

                <p>
                    I believe that apples in the sires represent the desires of the characters, one of the interpretations of the original 
                    paintings is about how it represents the views desires to understand the hidden truths of the paintings, more specifically 
                    the details of the man’s faces obscured by the apple.
                <br><br>
                    Some further proof of this is in episode 5 The Son of Man where Mischief directly discuses desires compering it too The Son of Man.

                    <p>
                        Henryk is clearly meant to represent The Son of Man in the show.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I believe there is a correlation between the apparent boringness of the original Son of Man with Henryk also seeming 
                        boring at first glance. In both cases it is not the appearance of the man that is meant to be interesting but the hidden 
                        details that are only hinted at in the original work. This could be supported by the chose to make Henryk a silent 
                        protagonist which makes him much more mysterious.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In short Henryk being represented by the son of man is a metaphor representing that Henryk is a lot more important and 
                        interesting than he first appears.

                    Episode 5 The Son of Man
                </b>
                <p>
                   The Son of Man is the focus of this episode and is likely being used as a metaphor for Mischief  not being able to understand 
                   what Henryk wants and Henryk not being able to understand modern the world they are in as he is stuck in the past rejecting the 
                   world as it is especially after the trauma of losing his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I believe that this is supported by the quote in the description (“Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see 
                   what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This 
                   interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden 
                   and the visible that is present.”)

                <p>
                   Mischief offers an apple to Henryk saying that the only thing that can be known for certain is that the truth will set 
                   him free. Henryk can be heard eating the apple before the scene changes. Before a scene is shown that depicts the painting 
                   The Son of Man.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This is likely meant to represent Henryk understand his desire to seek out his Great-Granddaughter and embracing that 
                   as his new goal.

                    Episode 24 The Abyss
                </b>
                <p>
                  Apples are more represent in Episode 24 than the Painting The Son of Man so I will be going over that separately here.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This heavily correlated with the main theme of Mischifes monologue which implies that choice is an illusion based in the 
                   perception of the individual. more specifically their lack of an ability for people to understand what drives them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is shown in the painting The Son of Man as the apple blocking his faces and the same is true for this episode of interfaces 
                  with Mischief blocking Henryk’s view.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This also relates to the episode The Son of Man as this theme is directly discussed there, though more from the perspective of 
                   Mischief not understanding Henryks desires.
                </p>

                <p>
                   Meny of René Magritte’s paintings include a theme of reality being filtered through the eye of the perceiver which is also true 
                   in The Son of Man.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In this episode we see Henryk raiser an apple obscuring his faces before launching at KAMI, and at a different point we see 
                   Mischief transform into an apple to be consumed by The Mechanical Saccorhytus.

                            I believe that in both scenes the apple is meant to represent desires. In the first scene we could see this as Henryk

                          Additional for Mischief the idea of a poisoned apple is common in media going back to story’s like sleeping beauty, 
                          there is also the idea of worms infesting apples which is a common theme in media worms are a form that Mischief 
                          commonly takes, so this could mean to imitate this symbolism.

                           In the second scene it would represent Mischief desire to infiltrate the Interfaces which is seemingly the motive for 
                           doing what he does through the series, especially in regard to his deal with The Ghost. This could also be because of 
                           the desire of The Mechanical Saccorhytus as he is shown as incredible glutens and hungry a simple desire but a desire 
                           non the less.
